65518	12622	10	thank you very much	nice to hear an AUD version of this show\nSince we all heard SBD during the webcast.\nthis show isn't on etree yet\nPerhaps consider uploading to http://bt.etree.org/index.php?cat=8 (this is the Dead Page)\n\nTonight was the night when a lot of people went from John Mayer WHO??  to John Mayer WHOA !!!	sueinphilly	2016-07-07 13:54:13-04	2015-11-09 11:20:11-05
65519	12622	10	great quality audience!	Sounds great MVB! Dead and Co. lays down another rock solid performance. MSG gets 0 stars for an unprecedented amount of baseless hassle, but 5 stars for MVB and Dead and Co.! Looking forward to Worcester!	tjvt	2016-07-07 13:54:13-04	2015-11-09 14:40:39-05

65521	12622	8	Great recording. Ok performance	Recording is awesome quality but the performance is my least favorite of the tour so far.\n Shakedown lacks oomph, TLEO is missing its lilt and lightness, Jack Straw and He's Gone sound Ratdog slow to me.This may be partially due to how high John is in the mix. I can hear every little nuance of his playing but can barely make out the rest of the band, especially Jeff.\nAs for John, he is undeniably a great guitarist. He does a better job of the basics then most but I don't get any sense of great creativity from him.I get the sense he is playing over the others instead of with them.\nI'm still ecstatic they're touring and look forward to hearing how they progress. \nRecording 5, Performance 3	jjuggler	2016-07-07 13:54:13-04	2015-11-09 20:20:46-05
65522	12622	8	the official name of the band is "Dead & Company"	The name of the recording should be changed to "Dead & Company" so that it all the recordings can be searched using the same name.\n	jr midtown	2016-07-07 13:54:13-04	2015-11-14 13:19:04-05
65523	12622	8	Priming the engine	I haven't seen the Grateful Dead since Jerry's last show in '95. The desire just wasn' there. That has all changed though. I work with a Phish-Head and his appreciation of the Dead has awoken my love of the band after 25 years of hibernation and now I find myself with a ticket in hand to truck up to Minneapolis on 11/21 to catch a Dead and Company Show. I was curious what the guys sounded like with John Mayer and I have to admit I am impressed. They sound good and for the first time since I was a young 20 something wipper-snapper, I am getting pumped to see a show! If the Dead-N-C sound this good when I see them, I will really happy!

65526	12623	10	Dead & Company Live At Nationwide Arena	Thank you so much for taping and uploading the audio for this particularly moving and fantastic concert. And thanks for the notes too! You all provide sacred content to relive these shows over and over!	Mimimph	2016-07-07 13:54:13-04	2015-11-16 14:03:23-05
65527	12623	8	13:31	Thanks for posting.  Was at the show and it was clear they are still a "new" band working out the kinks and timing.  Check out TN Jed at around 5:30.  You'll hear some original GD traveling.  John misses Bob's cue for the ending (around 6min) and what happened after that was pure gold.  Place was electric.  There are some other wonky moments but this was a solid show overall.	KillEer Bee	2016-07-07 13:54:13-04	2015-11-17 18:31:15-05
65528	12623	10	Great Show Overall	Was in the pit, started off near the back and worked our way in deep to Oteil side very close to the stage. The vocals were not clear as the stacks were "behind" us ,, but the stage sound was amazing. They played very tight.  The flubs were few and they got back on track quickly.  I did notice the John miscue someone else noted in their post ,,, the recovery was excellent (but his face gave it away that we was in a brain freeze for a moment).  Mickey went off to a hook/ending a bit early and the place went wild in appreciation ,,, that special synergy. Have to admit John did his homework and did an outstanding job. Oteil ,,, what an artist ,,, he is one with his bass and clearly very happy to be playing with this band. Setlist was strong and I could not be happier that I made the trip.	gnamian	2016-07-07 13:54:13-04	2015-11-18 17:35:56-05

I listen to all these shows - and now there's only one Dead & Company show left to be put up here -- 11/24/15 Broomfield Co.  I know someone out there has it & I really hope it gets put up here soon.  Now we have the 4 holidays shows to look forward to. I hope they do a webcast.

65540	12627	10	Grate Fun	1st  Vegas show was 1981 at the Aladdin, Friday left phx at 4 and flew back at 5 in morning, worst part had a  Saturday Ticket but tough week-end, so just got Friday Show , well worth the effort . MGM folks where good with the Circus and the Boys where high energy. Mickey throwing his leg up on Beam and Bob jumping up and down on Casey Jones .John has lit a fire so lets watch it burn ,Jeff and Oteil having a great time ,  Secure my Red Rocks Tickets and I will be there !	azforker	2016-07-07 13:54:14-04	2015-12-08 03:21:43-05
65541	12628	10	Great sound	Just wanted to say this is one of the best tapes I've heard from this tour; kudos! Excellent set list, though it's a shame Bobby's voice wasn't holding up (and was even worse the next night). He sounded in top form when I went the second night of the SF shows; I guess something about that bay area air is good for the voice.	guitarmanjb	2016-07-07 13:54:15-04	2016-01-05 01:22:11-05

65547	12629	10	The real thing?	John Mayer isn't Jerry, but he did a pretty damn good impersonation.  This is about as close to the sound real Grateful Dead as we're ever likely to get again.	hitmeister	2016-07-07 13:54:15-04	2016-01-13 07:23:34-05

Most of the time that's right, but not always, and especially worth a listen when there's only two copies of a show as in this case.  \nGreat job on this recording - definitely the sweetest sounding recording of this show and I'd venture to say among the better of the shows submitted so far for the first 14 shows (60 recordings - some great, most good, some bad)	slavetothegroove	2016-07-07 13:54:16-04	2015-11-23 07:33:09-05

65556	12633	10	Dead & Company, Worcester, November 10, 2015	This was a fun show, band finding their groove early on in the tour.  November 10 was a cold rainy night, drove down from NH.  Last time at the Centrum was for the Dead, November 1985, the place was much smaller than what I remembered.  Bill Walton and half the Celtics were hanging out on stage back then, sang Happy Birthday to Bill.  Anyway, here we have a very nice audience recording, solid, clean, full sound...good work!  Enjoyable listening, it's "hot and live".	ddupont0801	2016-07-07 13:54:16-04	2016-01-02 03:47:43-05

65560	12637	10	The recordings are part of the fun!	With so much fresh music, and all of these fresh recordings focused on the same band, I am having a great time checking out the recordings of the shows I attended. And, I am looking forward to hearing all of the other shows from this tour!\n\nMy Greensboro recording is no slouch. Atlanta? Not as well poised. Still, I posted my Atlanta recording, despite there already being at least two high-reference level recordings posted that were made from the dead center, behind the mixing, lighting and camera men. From their OTS vantage, the instrument clarity is excellent! Nevertheless, why not include mine, and its skewed perspective, even if it's wonky by comparison? \n\nThanks to archive.org for helping make come alive the historical record of this historical tour!\n\nGreensboro was a gem, that had good form throughout, and shone brighter until the end! So glad you made it!	Grahamps	2016-07-07 13:54:17-04	2015-11-21 18:53:15-05

And thanks for posting it so quickly!	gambit	2016-07-07 13:54:19-04	2015-11-13 17:44:40-05
65581	12643	8	Another Rock Solid and Entertaining show by Dead & Company !!!	Are you not entertained!!!!!   Anyways, I have thoroughly enjoyed this tour from song one... even from before while watching the Phil & Friends (June12 & 13, 2015) videos on Youtube. Of the four "Crossroads Music Festival" that Eric Clapton puts on every 3 years ('04, '07, '10, '13), John Mayer has been invited (Clapton invites the talent for his fest) all four times. Clapton has some pretty amazing things to say about the already phenomenal & still ever growing skill level of J. Mayer. Aide from playing guitar hours & hours per day, He has also always been a great listener of music & I recall an interview where he spoke of listening to hours & hours of music per day, from Hendrix to Stevie Ray, Miles and B.B. and all the other legends in between. One quote i'll paraphrase was about John listening to Jimi Hendrix' album, "Axis:Bold As Love," and he says he's trying to let his ears hear what Jimi is saying in his playing and John is thinking where do I go from here? (Musically speaking...) Tell me where to go? What secret notes and runs to play...     That was maybe 5-7 years ago when I heard that interview. It was only about 4 years ago that Mayer discovered the Greatness that is the otherworldly music of the Grateful Dead. He was listening to Pandora radio and heard the song "Althea."  And he truly heard it ..... the musicians & greats of our age spoke with their songs & playing and now four years later John Mayer is burnin' down every house he plays along side Bobby, Bill, & Mickey. Chimenti & Burbridge are always kickin ass too and have amazing pedigrees of their own. It's been pretty fun listening to the first 7-8 shows and even getting to watch a free webcast of one show.  Gotta love couch tour...  But I digress. Enjoy the music fellow Dead friends...	slavetothegroove	2016-07-07 13:54:19-04	2015-11-14 06:24:58-05

65583	12643	0	Thank You Tapers Who UPload & Archive	My Bus Captain, Cliff Pinkston was a taper so we often had a copyof the show blasting as we pulled off the lot.  It was so cool to be able to log on with my cell the next day and listen to last nights show via streaming whilst driving my rental car and being gently interrupted by gps to direct me through unknown lands.

They are tight and the music they play is totally mindblowing.

65600	12647	10	It is on!!!	Saw the boys over 100 times.  And nobody questions Garcia and his amazing abilities.  But let me say for the record if Garcia met Mayer in a guitar competition...well it would be one for the books.  This dude is spectacular.  And has brought the old gang to a sound and a energy/vibe that hasn't been felt or heard since Brent days.  88-89-90.  Solid years.  This group has that feel.  The purest need a reality check.  Listen and ask the question.  How amazing are they?  Oteil?  Seriously the dude is phenomenal.    Mayer is spectacular.  Jerry would be proud.  Keep playing!!  I've caught 5 shows this tour.  \nShoreline?\nExpo? \nGreek? \nFrost?  \nBring it.	Patman67	2016-07-07 13:54:20-04	2015-12-01 00:21:09-05

65602	12647	10	It is on!	I'm so amazed by the energy these guys are putting out! It's pretty amazing to think Mayer's first show was this summer! Wow.\nI made it to Worcester and it was solid. It sure feels like the Dead have a new lease on life with this lineup. Mayer is killing it! I just hope he keeps on touring - spring, summer and fall tour please!!	jamiex	2016-07-07 13:54:20-04	2015-12-01 21:39:29-05
65603	12647	10	Excellent	As others have already said, John Mayer added something special that I haven't seen in awhile. I am so glad they came to Denver.  Thanks for uploading this! Does anyone have the first night?	90sDeadHead	2016-07-07 13:54:20-04	2015-12-01 23:03:04-05
65604	12647	10	Stella Blue (Jerry lives!)	Mayer’s outro solo from 8 minutes on is beyond words.  It takes you back to the finest examples of Garcia’s versions, and reaches new heights, as if Garcia were given new fingers for his old bones.  It reminds me of what Derek Trucks was able to do for Duane Allman:  immerse himself in the emotional center of the man’s playing, and reach even higher.  So beautiful.	dcain	2016-07-07 13:54:20-04	2015-12-02 02:17:13-05

65609	12648	0	2016 Dead & Co. on Archive?	I just read that Dead & Co. are going to be making CDs and MP3 dls available for all 2016 shows. I'm guessing we will have to pay for them. Does anyone know if this means that no '16 shows will be posted here on Archive? That would be a damn shame. 	markharrison	2016-07-07 13:54:20-04	2016-05-31 01:57:21-04

If and when a Dead & Company collection gets set up, these recordings can be moved there. Until then, we have to live within the limitations.	vanark	2016-07-07 13:54:21-04	2015-11-15 17:27:34-05

65617	12653	10	Best of Tour?	This show has to be in the running for best of tour, imo.\nJohn and Oteil add so much energy to this band and this music.  I've seen just about every iteration of the Dead going back over 25 years, and this has to be one of the best.  John's guitar work captures the spirit of Jerry's playing, but within the framework of his own style.  In truth, Mayer's style on guitar was already very similar to Jerry's in their use of melodic runs tempered by just the right placement of tasty, twangy, bendy guitar riffs.  It really sounds like John and Oteil have taken the body of work, spirit and style from Jerry and Phil respectively and evolved it through to the next level within its own natural progression.  Really lovely playing throughout on this one.  I've never been a huge fan of Bobby's singing, but he has really been giving a great effort where that is concerned.  He has surpassed my expectations in that regard.  I think Bobby and John may play together as well as anybody since Jerry.\nI am so excited to be going to NYE!\nBy the way, this recording is as good as I've heard.  Great job Robert Mullen.  Nice presence across all frequencies.  Well balanced recording and well behaved audience around the tapers.	jpos	2016-07-07 13:54:22-04	2015-12-13 22:24:42-05

65642	12662	10	Loved this show, excellent start to Dead & Co! 	I'm very happy to say that I attended the first show of Dead and Co's debut fall 2015 tour.\n\nI attended this show with a friend from the Albany region, and I was very impressed.\n\nThe tunes that stand out to me in recollection are the Bird Song, The Music Never Stops, and Help / Slip / Franklin's.\n\nIt was pretty awesome how they opened the second set with Sailor / Saint and then went into Help / Slip / Franklin's. Sailor / Saint is one of my least favorite Dead jams, and Help / Slip / Franklin's is my #2 favorite. I actually did enjoy this spacey Sailor / Saint a lot, props to Bob! \n\nUnfortunately, I feel like Mayer's playing has gotten worse since this show. \n\nI'm seeing my second Dead and Co show later this month and I'm excited! 	dublindeuce	2016-07-07 13:54:24-04	2016-06-20 20:31:22-04

65645	12664	8	Thank you, for a real good time!	1) Thank you to the taper for making this available.\n2) Thank you to Bob, Bill, Mickey, Jeff, Oteil and John for keeping the Dead alive.\n3) The recording: it's a bit "echo-y" especially on the vocals but it largely has pretty good fidelity and it captures well the balance of instrumental and vocal roles.  Keyboards are well audible, often not the case in taper recordings.  I like audience sounds in these kinds of recordings cuz they remind me of my experience so "the clapper" doesn't bother me.\n4) The show: Seems that the band was playing when and what they wanted to, to a hometown audience which was appropriately appreciative.  The encores were great.\n5) Thank you to my son, Mick, who got on the bus with me and who guided our trip to this show and other places in San Fransisco.

65648	12664	10	Great show with a sweet, mellow mood...	John's singing of Standing on the Moon captures the mood of this show for me.  Being there in person and then hearing it here (thank you for posting the recording!), his voice is especially sincere and suited for this tune.  Bobby held nothing back with Black Throated Wind when seeing it live.  Doesn't come through on tape, but he had something to get out of his system when he performed it.

I happen to have probably the best seats of my life for a Dead show, sec 122 (first section next to the stage that isn't directly profile) \nI literally put the recorder in my breast pocket,  The on board microphones were crossed (not sure the actual term) and essentially pointing straight up to what would be the sound coming from the main speakers.\nI tried hard not to speak during the show, but some folks do speak around me a little bit, but not much.\n\nI then took the files and processed them through Audacity-  first Normalized and then Equalized in a basic way, chopped up the tunes into individual songs and then saved them as WAV files- and uploaded here.\n\nI'm by no means a taping expert as you can tell!

Highlights for me was them breaking out both Row Jimmy and Ramble On Rose, John Mayer sang "Get Out Of My Life, Woman" on a night that featured a total of five tour debuts. Terrapin was glorious and then we got a Dear Prudence! The GD never played this one together! Get Out Of My Life Woman was dedicated to Allan Toussaint who passed away the evening before. Going Down The Road Feeling Bad rocked as the closer! And then there was the Ripple encore. Both John and Bob on acoustics. A great night! I really appreciate how quickly this show got posted. Thanks!	Joe Antinucci	2016-07-07 13:54:26-04	2015-11-11 20:49:50-05

65670	12673	8	Sweet sounds in St. Louis - set one review	As of this shows end, So far this tour no song has been played more than four times.  Tonight, the first pair of songs were among those played repeatedly (a relative term for the DEAD) this tour, Shakedown Street and Brown-Eyed Women. Both songs sounded quite good, better than the versions preceding them this opening tour. I especially like Chimenti's soloing during Brown-Eyed Women. Shakedown Street has an excellent closing section (starting at 8:10) with the last section of verses and then a vocal breakdown about how every town has heart, you just gotta poke around. There's good people & good times everywhere, you just gotta find them.  Such great lyrics...   Up next, New Minglewood Blues is sung strong & well and John Mayer's guitar work really shines, except when Bob overdoes his slide guitar part from about 5:05 - 6:05, ugh - a whole minute of that screeching and then John takes it back into the stratosphere to finish it off. The rock 'n' roll vibe  of Minglewood gave way to a breezy, bouncy, and mellow They Love Each Other.  Mayer sounds great singing this song (and Brown-Eyed Women) and his slow jam licks are spot-on.  I really dig this song.  For the Fifth song of the set, we have a tune new to this tour, Black-Throated Wind.  This has long been one of my favorite "Bobby" songs. The lyrics are so trippy and I love the cosmic-blues-rock singing done over the quirky road song. I thought it achieved lift-off and got the crowd pumped up for a rousing and stellar version of Sugaree. John' blues vocals were on display and the band had a thick groove swinging.  The playing was great but at times the crowd's singing/cheering covered some of that up. Not much though, so no big deal.  Finally to end the set, The Music Never Stopped.  How can anyone who appreciates music not like this song.  The music, the lyrics, the overall vibe... this is one of those perfect songs.	slavetothegroove	2016-07-07 13:54:27-04	2015-11-22 01:33:21-05

65672	12673	10	Wow!	This is outstanding sound quality! I feel its about as good as what would come out on cd or download if ever! Amazing show, was blown away with some history of lady with a fan into terrapin by a guy during the song. I was blown away in general...Never seen any combination of the boys that sounds this good, nor quality of a show that ever sounded this great. Not only did everything have so much depth and clarity to every song but you captured that without to much noise!\n\nNote: I havent a clue how to download or if I can download this show from here? Everything comes up either getting played or as a single file, however I would love to get ahold of this anyway I can if theres anyway to do so?	campingatZoe	2016-07-07 13:54:27-04	2015-11-23 18:10:10-05

65674	12673	8	Let Mayer sing the Jerry tunes Bobby!!!	It gets so irritating !!!! John has the proper voice tone for the Jerry tunes and ballads !!!! Please please.... I know you all have to feel the same way! The crowd noise when Bobby finally let's Mayer sing a tune is incredibly loud! So it shows they want Mayer to sing more ! The dude has a good voice for gods sake!	DustTizzle	2016-07-07 13:54:27-04	2015-11-27 12:45:25-05

Overall sound quality is very good for an open air mic.

I will enjoy these audio files for the rest of my lifetime.	ColoradoHippie	2016-07-07 13:54:28-04	2015-12-18 12:04:59-05
65685	12679	8	18 Anymores...	That was fun show and I have been waiting to double check on the anymores - 18 it is!  Black Peter was a highlight for me.  I also had heard some complaining about the pace of the songs being too slow during the tour.  They do sound slow on the recordings, but in-=ersonthey sounded just right.	mdcoyle	2016-07-07 13:54:28-04	2015-12-28 23:08:40-05

65691	12685	10	WOW	Best live dead show that I have ever seen (no- I never saw Jerry live). John Mayer has breathed life back into this band. Oteil added a much needed funk that was missing. & the GD team just fed right off of it. They were absolutely magical on this Halloween night. The crowd was blown away.Thank you guys for keeping the magic alive.	fishndrum	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-02 15:12:52-05

65693	12685	10	Great Show and Recording	What a recording! This was an excellent show from start to finish. This is also a really good audience recording. It stinks that it seems soundboards of this tour will not be made available but if more recordings are as good as this one it will be okay.	Saint-O	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-03 03:32:27-05
65694	12685	10	WaaaaaHooooo	We saw the Albany Show & there we saw what they could do! But once they got going from start to finish on this Halloween night it was face melting scream your guts out can't smile hard enough freaking Dead FUN!!!!  I saw the boys 37 times from 1987 to 1994 in those shows I saw with Jerry there was always at least one or two face melting moments & I was lucky enough to see a few face melting shows! I thought I would never be this happy about going to see the Dead again BUT It's here NOW in the form of Dead & Company. My wife & I have seen Albany & both MSG shows 31st & 1st we have one more to go at the DCU center on Mass. on the 10th. If this band keeps up this pace & excellence & mastery of the music we love well then once again we are the most spoiled fans EVER!!!	gr8fulTrent	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-03 07:32:34-05
65695	12685	10	Dead & Company MSG 10-31-15	First off...tons of gratitude to the taper for this. I was at both MSG shows and I've been to lots of concerts in my life...great concerts, yet never in my life have I ever experienced such complete joy in music and in a band. I agree with the previous poster that John Mayer breathed new life into these gorgeous songs with his guitar virtuosity, deep love and passion for the music and his beautiful connection with Bob, Mickey, Bill, Oteil and Jeff. I know he prepared fiercely for these concerts before the rehearsals, how much the music means to him deep down in his soul and how important it was for him to honor Jerry while not duplicating or being derivative. With his elegant style as a musician and performer I think he accomplished his mission. All the band members are superb, the production was top notch and the music is simply glorious. Night 2 was the same.	Mimimph	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-03 13:51:48-05
65696	12685	10	Absoulte Perfect Quality	I realllllly wish i was at this show. This set list is great. I Like it better than when I saw them in Albany. John Mayer sounds great. Loving the jam and crowd vibes at the end of Deal, I got chills!	dayneno	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-03 17:21:08-05

65698	12685	10	Stand Alone	First off, great recording.  You can hear everyone, which is big because everyone is playing really, really well.  Second, why all the haters?  Too many people are coming down on the latest incarnation, spending a lot of time with harsh comparisons to what was.  Well, too me, that is completely unfair.  You need to judge this group on who they are now and how they are playing.  They aren't the Grateful Dead, nor should they be.  I see them as a group of fantastic musicians who are giving all the rest of us the opportunity to gather together again and enjoy the circus, reuniting with old friends and making new ones. That's one hell of a gift in my eyes.  And Mayer is proving a great number of people wrong; I must admit I was rather skeptical when the announcement first came, but, holy crap, he is a fantastic musician and playing the music with all  the reverence and style it deserves.  Its more than obvious that he "gets it".   Well done boys, and thank you.	SomeDarkHollow	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-05 13:26:28-05
65699	12685	10	Great Show, spectacular edition	Probably the best show I've seen of the various group versions since Jerry passed. Great energy (can't remember the last time I saw Bobby jumping around). Mayer and Oteil awesome, Jeff expressive. Those three add a youthful exuberance to the music. They were really tight for only their second show together. Think what they'll be like after a couple dozen? Foolish to compare to the band 30-40 years ago. This is different. Thanks for uploading, super clean recording. Odd that there is no tapers section, but whatever...	BertGuts	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-06 19:35:06-05

65701	12685	10	Halloween @ The Garden	THE BEST TIME EVER!!!\n\nI took my uncle (Me & My Uncle) to his first show ever, we had the time of our lives.  He got to meet friends of mine I made over the FB Dead & Company Fan Page, we explored NYC, and enjoyed the night.  Have to say, I never heard of John Meyer before, and now that I've seen him in action he was worth watching.	dovbear	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2015-11-12 14:20:38-05
65702	12685	8	To Captain Comic	In all my years I've never seen a comment like yours. It makes you sound like the biggest prick on the planet. Are any of these really anyone's recordings but the band? Really. You own the tape, but you don't own what's on it. If you want to keep your recordings just for yourself, don't put them up on etree, or better yet, sell your equipment to someone who shares the music like everyone else; and stop being such a fucking cry baby about it. What, are junior high? Nice recording nonetheless.	t1479ce	2016-07-07 13:54:30-04	2016-03-14 13:01:45-04
65703	12685	8	Halloween Show MSG	The only thing better than seeing the Dead is seeing them on Halloween, and the only thing better than seeing the Dead on Halloween is seeing them on Halloween in MSG.

In particular, for me, the Half Step stood out. First set was burning, and the second set was a little sloppy. But, there were definitely some very high points during the second.

65713	12687	10	This Sugaree....	I've listened to a few earlier shows, like from October of this year.  It's clear that at this point these guys have found their groove and are just killing it.\n\nSugaree is one of my favourites, exemplified by what Jerry was doing with the song in '77.  This interpretation of the song, and that solo, holy crap -- if anyone had any doubts about this lineup, just queue up the 2015-12-31 version of Sugaree and tell me there's no magic here.\n\nCan't wait to see them when they come through town later this year.

65714	12687	10	Wow -- 3 Sets of hot Rock, Blues and Jam. Mayer Brings it with Bobby	I was skeptical about Mayer. No longer after 3 months of touring with the boy's this evening shown it all.  As others have noted, Sugaree is sweet, but so is In the Midnight Hour and Sugar Magnolia.  Drum is tripsy -- this is like a 1977 show. DAMN FINE.

65723	12688	10	Thanks!	Had a blast at the show. Oteil and Jeff were stepping up and sounding great, and John sounded more comfortable and expansive. The core boys were on as always. Great sounding Ramble and LOVED Drums/Space in person.\n\nReally appreciate you posting this so soon.	Dmoser	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-11 19:41:52-05
65724	12688	10	Amazing Show!	Thanks for uploading! Whole show was great but Deal through Terrapin is sublime	smithstrat	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-11 19:52:17-05
65725	12688	10	Mayer!	Wow, Mayer is such a great fit. What a surprise! Better than other incarnations like Trey, Warren or Kimmock... Those guys are monsters, but seem to be best at their own music in my opinion. I also like Mayers soulful vocals. Long live the Dead!	Emando	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-11 19:59:44-05
65726	12688	8	Whoa!  What a night!	Highlights for me was them breaking out both Row Jimmy and Ramble On Rose, John Mayer sang "Get Out Of My Life, Woman" on a night that featured a total of five tour debuts.  Terrapin was glorious and then we got a Dear Prudence!  The GD never played this one together! Get Out Of My Life Woman was dedicated to Allan Toussaint who passed away the evening before.  Going Down The Road Feeling Bad rocked as the closer!  And then there was the Ripple encore.  Both John and Bob on acoustics.  A great night! I really appreciate how quickly this show got posted.  Thanks!	Joe Antinucci	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-11 20:22:24-05
65727	12688	10	Superb recording!	WOW.  Oteil and Jeff are right there in the mix.  This sounds fantastic.  Really dug hearing the stream live last night, but this recording is a true gem.  Thanks for sharing!	Sounds4u	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-11 21:14:19-05
65728	12688	10	What an excellent show - Great recording too	This was a great show.  Worcester was the only show I saw this tour but that's okay because it was a great show!  Otiel, John and Jeff really gelled with Bobby, Mickey and Bill.  Hopefully this won't be the only tour with this line-up.  I would love to get another chance to see them in the future.\n\nThis recording is excellent.  It is crisp and clear and really captures the energy of the show.  Thank you so much.\n\n--Gr8fulGeoff	Gr8fulGeoff	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-11 23:01:28-05
65729	12688	8	Is it just me?	The sound was great, the lights were great, the company I was with was outstanding and this recording is very good. I've been involved with these guys since Worc '83 and all phases of Post Dead and have loved it all! This lead guitar player just didn't do it for me. IMHO.

65730	12688	10	sick show A+ recording	JPM67, not gonna say it's just you, but I will say I could not disagree more. You just cannot do what Mayer is doing without soul imo. I thought this show was incredibly tight and just awesome. I literally could not be happier with the job that Mayer is doing in this role (skill, feel, attitude, improvisation, etc., etc.). The entire band chemistry is palpable to me. They have got it goin' on!! Keep on rockin' Dead and Co., and thanks MVB for an equally awesome recording!!	tjvt	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-12 15:22:09-05
65731	12688	10	Drums was the highlight?	I thought Mayer was excellent!  I thought of Jerry during Ramble On Rose when John's playing was properly mixed with the rest - it was subtle but excellent!  I don't know how else to explain it but I enjoyed hearing John all night as part of the band.  I'm glad he got to sing too.\n\nI did not expect to enjoy Drums but I was blown away when Oteil started playing on Bill's set.  The lights were amazing and I waited to take a bathroom break until Space started.	faeden	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-12 16:54:48-05
65732	12688	8	sublime	wonderful taping job and quick upload. Much better than the FTW stuff the band released today - the "Best of" from Chicago. After listening to both today, I'll take this over any of these three shows for the quality of the sound, and the playing.	deadintx	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-12 22:22:40-05
65733	12688	10	Cheers John!	Mayer did a great job.  No,, he's not the great Garcia, but he's not bad!	scobourn	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-13 03:03:18-05
65734	12688	10	WOW!!	What a smoking show! Mayer blew my expectations out of the water! I enjoy this lineup more than the furthur line up! Killer recording! Grate,Grate,Grate..A++ for sound!	PapaZulu	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-11-13 14:03:42-05

65742	12688	8	some highlights (Sugaree and...)	Row Jimmy is notable:  Weir starts rowing with his guitar (yep) at 7:48 (you can see this on the crystal clear video by Johnny A), and Mayer delivers wonderful fills during the singing of the "gonna get there" chorus.  First time played of three during the tour (11-21 and 11-27), great work.\n\nSugaree is Mayer's signature song and he delivers the goods.  His first two solos are refreshingly restrained and short, saving the heavy hitting for his third time round at  6:52.  He opens with chords and speed and takes off with passion and creativity worthy of Garcia, culminating in a frenzied blur around 7:45 and another peak around 8:11.  Worth the price of admission and then some.\n\nRamble on Rose is another tune that suits Mayer perfectly (Weir's singing is actually OK on this)(sort of).  Check out his second set of solos after the piano around 5:22 and again at 6:35, simply stunning.  Beautiful to hear the crowd in full throat on the "royal flush" behind Weir.\n\nBig River, not as successful, the solo is fairly ordinary, what any very talented cover player might do.   Deal was a quandry for them every time played (10/31, 11/18, 11/28), with some real confusion about who should solo, when, and how to get to the final chorus.  But by 6:49 all that is under the bridge and Mayer is free to rock out on the three chords and it finally works.\n\nThe transition from there to Uncle Johns is seamless, a bit of good old Grateful Dead-style magic.  Dear Prudence, played twice on the tour (11-21), Mayer's solo starting around the 5 minute mark is is not to be missed, a triumph.  Thanks for sharing the nice recording of the show...	dcain	2016-07-07 13:54:31-04	2015-12-26 02:13:50-05

65754	12691	10	Magic in the air	Excellent recording and another strong show. Weir and the Rhythm Devils sounding rejuvenated. Oteil and Chimenti showing their class. And I can only feel sorry for the self-appointed 'elite' of dead heads who don't get Mayer, cause no doubt he is a masterful guitarist who is able to put a new spin on things and at the same time staying true to the (Garcia) tradition.	zenm00n	2016-07-07 13:54:32-04	2015-11-19 11:26:24-05

65756	12691	6	Yes	Like it. Miss jerry, some of the songs get muffed up, but for a band at their tenth show all is well with these folks. For those who dont get mayer, neither do I, but whatever. The New Years run should be interesting, and the future looks good.	Niass200	2016-07-07 13:54:32-04	2015-11-19 20:50:04-05
65757	12691	8	Beautiful sound!	I also recorded this show (outside of the tapers section). This beautiful recording makes mine sound just "cute." There's little comparison between the two, except we recorded the same show! \n\nMy feeling is the the Atlanta show itself was more off-the-mark than the others I've heard. Thankfully, I was at Greensboro. Because, after attending Saturday night in NC, my expectations were that Atlanta was going to be even better. Well, my two cents is that the first set of Greensboro was brick solid, if polite. The second set in Greensboro ascended all the way to the end of One More Saturday Night, and landed so fine with the FOTD encore. Following a similar structure, Atlanta never fully matched up. \n\n3 stars for the show. 5 for the recording.\n\nWhat a great tour this has become for so many who've attended! I'm so glad I made it!	Grahamps	2016-07-07 13:54:32-04	2015-11-20 00:04:10-05
65758	12691	10	Awesome Recording and Show!	First, many thanks to Z-Man. I do not know the technical details, but this sounds damn good to me. \n\nI have listened to other shows is all. I thought this one was the best to date, but I always seem to like the shows I see the best.\n\nI love it! No Mayer regrets for me! I am just a listener who has been fortunate to have stumbled on this band back in the early 70s and they keep on giving.\n\nTo get the chance to see this line-up here in Atlanta was fantastic! The whole experience was wonderful. Then a member of the community offers up this beautiful recording! \n\nMy take is that some have been shaken by the emotional roller coaster of Jerry passing, FTW, Mayergate, and the emergence of an engaging Grateful Dead touring band without Phil. This recording speaks for itself if you care to listen.	GregAtlanta	2016-07-07 13:54:32-04	2015-11-20 16:58:36-05
65759	12691	10	Great energy!!	Thanks Z-Man for the recording! I went to Greensboro prior and found that to be a solid show. Had high expectations for Atlanta primarily because its where Mayer started as a professional and had a bit more to "prove" to the ATL. And in one the few instances of the scores of shows I've seen, they blew those expectations away! The energy was off the hook! A real barn burner of a show in today's era, with few if any down moments. \n\nYes it's 2015, it's Bob's band and he's all about keeping it down tempo. But it's been that way before and THE 20 years since we lost dear Jerry. As for Mayer, he fits in well, has the chops, plays great fills without overdoing it...  If only Bob would relinquish more lead vocals to him! He owned the Franklin's! Jeff is amazing and it's so great to hear the B3 after Vince was told back in the day after Brent, there was to be no B3. As for Oteil, his bass lines are a bit more catchy than we are used to with Phil's but he stays true to them and it works - not to mention his vocal harmonies are spot on. \n\nLastly, I went to all five FTW shows and while the emotional gravity of those nights were unequaled, the band this evening in Atlanta was in high gear mid-tour form, without the added pressures of so called farewell shows.	ajn3323	2016-07-07 13:54:32-04	2015-11-21 01:33:33-05

65778	12701	8	Tremendous...Best they have sounded in YEARS!	What a show...John Mayer is freaKing KILLING IT!\nThe most powerful playing of this music i have heard since 1995...\nI mean, I LOVE Warren Haynes...Probably my Favorite guitar player on the planet currently and he was great in that "Role", but this was so much better than that era..\nFare The Well shows were okay, but Trey just went out an was "uncomplimentary" to ALMOST every song he "played"..\nFor whatever reason, this guy is a whole new animal...Playing so accurately, it is scary...How can you just suddenly play like this? I know he is a great player, but to grasp this particular music in the way he has is just unreal..Best fit yet!\nI only wish i had more tickets...\nThank You for sharing...Gonna play this one LOUD!

65781	12701	8	Very Nice Recording	Thanks for uploading!  Really enjoyed the show.  Easily the most powerful post-Jerry iteration of the Dead machine.  While most every song had a rough spot, it's still hard to believe this unit has only played live together 4 times because they also brought each song to life and took them to new places.  The set list may look pedestrian on paper, but just like in the old days the songs didn't matter so much as how they were played.  I hope these guys stick together for a bit.  Would see again.	spring mountain high	2016-07-07 13:54:33-04	2015-11-06 19:07:58-05
65782	12701	6	great recording - but what is up with people at shows these days?	Recording is great except for the crazy guy yelling at the taper that his microphones are in the way. I have never heard anything like that on an audience recording before. Such a bummer.	raindogg	2016-07-07 13:54:33-04	2015-11-07 01:28:47-05

From out the gate with Here comes sunshine and on.  Maybe because I'm not a Mayer fan? Yes I listened tot he entire tape and many are my fav- China cat, Playing in the band, Loose Lucy.

65788	12701	10	Thanks,too much noise, showw was prety good actually	Umm, this recording doesnt do it for me, we thought it was ok, very good, my friend thought the 2nd set stranger was excellent,very rubbery, too much Nitrous led to a particularly rubbery event. This must be the sphectrum? 11/5? 11/6/79 is a killer show and there are echoes of that in here. We need the SBD. The crowd is beyond idiotic and it was indeed shocking. I've been to 200 plus shows and I have never seen people actually yelling drunk at tapers or right next to the taping section prior to this,ever,at least onthis planet. . Drunk morons, standing there like screaming "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT POLE THING." This was a thing that happened at all the easties. And then the California shows were totally mellow and normal. Get the SBD this show ain't bad, I couldn't tell which one was jerry at this show, Bob looked like him last year but?  but I admit I was a bit out there. Does anyone know? This show gets a 5 for effort by Bob and the person willing to tape this while being accosted by east coast deadheads. I am from Mass, and I have never seen anything..like that' since...Irvine 87 or was it 88, when they or was it we crashed the gate......anyways let's do it again soon. Email me the SBD, we all know no one is buying this stuff should the Band try selling it, but We need a copy from the Board so you canhear what they are trying to say.

65789	12701	10	I was there. 	recording does not do it justice. I feel bad for dude who said he was at over 200 shows and doesn't GET IT. There is a whole new generation, even 2 that do not KNOW what WE do or SHOULD. Lead by example. The music industry has gone to shit. If not for us then WHO? 200 shows? Ya never blacked out a show? Never acted the fool? \n   I had to cancel my Chicago shows due to health so I was elated just to be going. Elated that even 50 years later and I am still going to see the Dead in one form or another YEARLY! The biggest problem I saw with the whole show? How do you explain that they opened with a ROCKING, "Here Comes Sunshine"???	sweendog67	2016-07-07 13:54:33-04	2016-02-18 17:59:46-05

65801	12707	10	Dead & Company MSG 11-1-15	First off...tons of gratitude to the taper for this. I was at both MSG shows and I've been to lots of concerts in my life...great concerts, yet never in my life have I ever experienced such complete joy in music and in a band.  John Mayer breathed new life into these gorgeous songs with his guitar virtuosity, deep love and passion for the music and his beautiful connection with Bob, Mickey, Bill, Oteil and Jeff. I know he prepared fiercely for these concerts before the rehearsals, how much the music means to him deep down in his soul and how important it was for him to honor Jerry while not duplicating or being derivative. With his elegant style as a musician and performer I think he accomplished his mission. All the band members are superb, the production was top notch and the music is simply glorious. Both nights were glorious and so very satisfying!	Mimimph	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-03 14:06:29-05
65802	12707	4	Great show.	This recording is way too hot and not in a good way. I was hoping someone got a decent copy of this recorded. Hopefully another version emerges soon because this really was a great show!	meandmrt	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-04 00:15:27-05
65803	12707	10	Thank You Taper!	Wow what an amazing two days.  Thank you posting this.\nThe music was some of best live stuff I've heard in decades.\nBobby had the band ripping.  The place was electric.	CosmicHart	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-04 12:57:56-05
65804	12707	6	Yep	Yes, sounds overdriven and distorting on  the file I got. Would like to listen to it but too painful...dang.	seaweedsteve@yahoo.com	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-05 03:05:38-05
65805	12707	10	Grateful to be there	Thanks for the tape. Being at this show was one of the highlights of my concert-going career. It's easy to see why the band loves jamming with John Mayer. The place was totally gaga over his guitar playing, with tons of peak moments. When Bobby belted out the extra long "Searchlight casting....." the crowd swelled with love. It was another great moment in the history of the greatest band of all time!	georgiasam	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-05 15:11:05-05
65806	12707	6	No Taper's Section	Thanks for recording/ uploading this! -- Unfortunately it IS recorded really hot.  I heard that there is no Taper's Sections for these shows. So we may have to hear cell phone recordings, or clandestine devices. It was such an incredible show!  I hope we can get a better recording.	anthonywcorrell	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-05 16:42:12-05
65807	12707	2	Great set - HORRIBLE recording	This is one of the greatest sets I've ever seen. But the taper had his record levels set up in the stratosphere. Unless you like constant distortion the whole time you're listening to a set, this recording will annoy you to death. I tried to fix it with Sound Forge and some other things. It's way beyond fixable.	JackStrawfromArkansas	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-07 22:43:08-05

65810	12708	8	Could Go Either Way, But Props to Mayer	This is a tough one to judge, especially given this is the first live show with this line up.  On the plus side Mayer fits in amazingly well.  His playing is subdued yet really gives some power when needed.  Oteil is a true beast and Chimenti is fantastic.  Billy and Mickey are ageless.  Bobby...um...let's see...he should never sing again (IMHO).  It's like trying to hear your dying grandfather's last words on his deathbed.  Not to sound morose or anything.  I'm not sure he can hold out for a bunch of shows. Too bad they couldn't bring in a guest vocalist to help out (no, not Donna...although she might be an improvement).  \nThe recording is quite good. Thanks for getting it up so quickly.\n4 stars for the recording/3.5 for performance.\nI bet the playing gets better going forward however, I look forward to more uploads of this quality.	SomeDarkHollow	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 16:20:51-04
65811	12708	8	Reply about Bobby	I listened to the stream last night and think your comments about Bob are pretty unfair.  He sounded ragged at times and not at his best, but it wasnt horrible like you describe.  Would you have rather seen Phil sing those songs?  Hornsby might have been a nice fit in this group as well, but nothing to be done about it.  I was skeptical about Mayer, but after last night I am all in on Dead and Co for this tour.\n\nReally solid for a tour opener.  I would need to listen again, but I would say this is superior to the 2009 Dead tour opener in Greensboro that I caught.	sgio95	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 16:30:50-04
65812	12708	10	High Steppin	show was outtah sight, Band came on an stole my face for 2 sets.  Band appeared to be having a blast up there. all smiles. Bobby was very animated and  had a clear strong voice from where I stood on rail.  Great song selection for opener.  Film crew recorded show for Live Nation.  Show & Neighbor's were fantastic   Found sweet spot with recording. Thank you  for quick up ... tough spot behind board.	ralberty	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 17:37:55-04
65813	12708	10	Oteil is the man	I wasn't sure how the band would be without Phil, but Oteil sounds amazing. He really gets cooking during the Music Never Stopped. The sound guy brings Oteil up in the mix during the second set, and the whole band sounds dramatically better. The whole show is great. Mayer's playing is on point, the drums are rockin, Oteil is groovin, Jeff is awesome as always, and Bobby's voice gets better as the night goes on. The recording is very clean and mixed well too. A+	Insanity'sKing	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 17:41:41-04
65814	12708	10	.	Great show thanks for the upload.  Sound quality at the show was inconsistent and I imagine hard to tape, nice to be able to hear otiel on this recording.  you can tell they practiced and had a good time playing.   4.5	djnickelb	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 20:22:03-04
65815	12708	10	The music never stops	A fine recording and a strong debut from this exciting band. Mayer certainly shows his class and every doubt wether he can get 'psychedelic' can now be put to rest. Bob and the Rhythm Devils in fine form. Oteil and Chimenti just excellent musicians. \n\nA well-rehearsed band and not affraid to take chances. Lets hope they can build on this and make the whole tour stellar.	zenm00n	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 22:01:53-04
65816	12708	10	great recording; great show	Thank you so much for this!!!!  I have tickets for the STL show, and this just whets my appetite.  TN Jed, Sailor>Saint, H>S>F, some real highlights here.  Loved it.  If any criticism, I'd like more John Mayer singing (Bob seemed a bit strained by the end) and I couldn't pick out Oteil's bass very well.  Otherwise, real, real good.	spyguy29	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 22:13:12-04

65817	12708	10	In Good COMPANY	First off thanx Bill for the upload GRATE Job, I'm digging the tempo the gang is playing in 2009 tour was very slow last night Bill And Mickey were a driving force and steered the ship Bob Kept up fine. I knew Otiel and the drummers would gel fine,like everyone else in the Deadhead community i was a little skeptical about John (playing and singing) though i did trust when the said he fits right in,and man does he ever he did his homework and passed the first test he's got a good tone an the geetar and his voice fits better than Trey's or Warren's IMO I think his playing fits better as well(he should sing like that on his own material) maybe he'll start a good band after this tour he's got a lot of Heads on board after opening night you know it's only gonna get better. I hope this goes so well they'll wanna do a summer tour,next stop for me Truckin' up to Buffalo...	grateful greensky	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-30 22:21:47-04

65820	12708	10	It's all good	Some of you need to be reminded that we are lucky to have anyone still playing this music. Grow up. Would you have it that the music died along with Garcia? STFU and enjoy. Or get the fk out of the  line.	Bigfolkie	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-31 13:29:16-04
65821	12708	8	COMPANY MAN	Awesome start of tour show. John Mayer really immersed himself in this music. His playing hit the right tone most of the time and he lifted the band and crowd to soaring heights a number of times. Right out of the gate- The first set outstanding -highlights to me were CRAS, TJ, TMNS.  The  Help>Slipknot>FT was the second set standout. My only criticism is that i would prefer tor hear a couple more songs rather than drums and space (not a fan).Anyone who doubted Mayer could pull this off doesn't know his live playing ability and the depth of his recent immersion and love for this music.He demonstrated both to a level that even exceed my own expectations. This- IMHO- IS FAR AND AWAY THE BEST POST-JERRY INCARNATION OF THE BAND. I can't wait to see them SUNDAY night at MSG though I am coflicted about missing game 5 of world series.   ***  LET'S GO METS!  ***	feuerfam4	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-10-31 18:06:18-04

65823	12708	8	an Awesome tour opener...	I really dig this show.  There's a vibe of excitement around the formation of the new band. They picked some great songs to showcase the new sound.  Set one highlights for me are: Cold Rain & Snow, Tennessee Jed, He's Gone, Bird Song, & The Music Never Stopped. It also helps to have a 15 minute Truckin opener and a 15 minute mid-set Feel Like A Stranger.  That's all the songs in the first set so we're off to a good start.  \nSet Two is full of goodies - depending on what your bag is.  I like Lost Sailor>Saint of Circumstance, but there's many other songs  that would have been better for night one. But I'm not a legend or well respected and accomplished musician in the jamrock world, so what do I know?  I do know that the 22 minute Help On the Way/Slipknot/Franklins Tower fit perfectly after Lost Sailor/Saint, and it really smoked. The band was percolating some groovy sounds and each member contributed in spades, as they did all show long.  Drums & Space we're pretty sweet - if that's your thing.  Stella Blue was well-done and probably the perfect ballad for night one (perhaps Comes A Time would be equally as great).  Not Fade Away to close the show was euphoria-inducing.  No matter how many times I hear this song it always hits the spot, especially when jammed out.  And A touch of Grey encore was a fitting way to say we will get by and we will survive, on top of the fact that our love will not fade away.  More truly magical music is being made for us.  I cant wait to hear it all...	slavetothegroove	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-22 00:49:55-05

65881	12725	10	WOW!!!	That was one heck of a show!!! Thanks so much Bill for the great recording & gettin it up so fast!!! I love seeing a show then being able to record it & jam out in the car to it all over again, so again thank you Bill & all other tapers. From last falls shows (Albany, MSG 31st & 1st & DCU center) to now is how do I say? Cuz they were pretty damn good last year but what I, we heard last night was a very very good band that is gelin very well together. I've said it before, we are the most spoiled fans in the history of music (IMO) can't wait for Citi field & Hartford!!! here's to hoping we see you out having fun dancing & shaking those bones!!!	gr8fulTrent	2016-07-07 13:54:39-04	2016-06-22 20:43:04-04
65836	12711	8	what a show	This was quite a fantastic evening. I'm thoroughly impressed with the chemistry John, Oteil, and Jeff bring to the band. The segue from Truckin' to Big Boss Man was awesome - good to hear them doing the Pigpen tune. The second set was just amazing! Bertha was played with the energy of years past and the band didn't let up the momentum until Drums>Space. The entire place was dancing and grooving during Scarlet>Fire. I usually don't pay much attention to Drums>Space but this rendering was definitely worth it. The Wheel is one of my favorite Dead songs and I was so happy to hear them do this late in the second set.\n\nI hope these guys continue to play in this lineup!	bmrobin	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-07 16:59:34-05
65837	12711	8	Nice!	Thank you for the recording. Great overall sound. A little clipping in Drums > Space really had my subwoofer booming throughout the house!	papafost	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-07 18:56:54-05

65839	12711	10	Talk about quickly posting ...	Thanks a lot for the post, very quick to say the least (~);} \nI used my DR-40, as wouldn't lemme get rig in, internal mics ... haven't listened to it yet ... was behind stage getting off rear stacks (with no one even close to deck most of the show)	ChinaKatz	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-07 23:46:16-05
65840	12711	10	Winning LOSER	I said after hearing show 1 in Albany that this is the best post-jerry incarnation of the band. After seeing them last Sunday at msg and listening to the Philly and DC shows there is no contest . These guys are taking the music on trips they haven't seen since the  80's. By taking these songs into his soul John Mayer is giving the music and the band new life. Bobby's voice and playing seems livelier than in recent times. Oteil and Jeff fit perfectly. These guys are sounding better every show. I keep going back to LOSER from 4:30-9:00 - it summons the magical roller coaster feel of Garcia. One of the most smoking versions I've ever heard.	feuerfam4	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-07 23:53:21-05
65841	12711	10	Thank you!	Thanks for taping this amazing show! John Mayer was fantastic, my God, he can play.  I just hope he stays with this awhile before moving on. The show was magical, I haven't felt that way in 20 years. Eyes was beyond words. Brought my teenagers - passing the torch :).  Love.	kerryparis	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-08 13:31:51-05
65842	12711	10	A Tear	I have tears in my eyes a bit. It seems our band is back and remade from the remnants that are left. This sounds moving, real and something to root for. I look forward with great anticipation to Phillips next Tuesday. Took 'em 20 years but by the sond of it they got it right. Kudos to Mayer for respecting the music - it shows. Never in a million years would I have thought this wold work out. There is always hope.	GeorgiPat	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-09 19:30:22-05
65843	12711	10	So good!!!	First off, THANK YOU for taping!!!\n\nThe whole second set was just so good. Personal highlights were Eyes to Fire and also The Wheel (wow!!!) to Midnight Hour.  The whole show was great but the whole second set was a monster.	K_cosmos	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-10 00:05:31-05
65844	12711	10	Best tour recoring so far	Absolutely amazing sound. What a great job done. Amazing. Best versions of Bertha and many others. Eyes? Crazy. Great job and thank you. This is pro recording.	DeadHead68	2016-07-07 13:54:35-04	2015-11-18 07:17:25-05

65846	12712	8	On the road again	Love the audience, love the cavernous sound, so live or "hot" as the Bear would say.  Must be fun to be back out there, did a few tours in the mid 80s, fall tours on the East Coast was such a blast.  Thank you.	ddupont0801	2016-07-07 13:54:36-04	2015-11-03 07:41:30-05

65853	12719	10	Incredible Show	This audio sounds amazing, and the atmosphere and the show itself was great, there was something really special about Scarlet that night, there really wasn't a lacking moment at all. Thank you so much for uploading this, I'm glad I can re-listen to this and remember it, thank you. It sounds fantastic, I hope you also had fun at the show! I'm glad I was able to be shook by the beam, nothing like it. Anyways, back to listening!	jesse.molen	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-23 16:29:15-05
65854	12719	10	Dead & Company and the Tapers are amazing	First of all thank you to Dead and Company for getting together and playing the music I love.  Every band member has been amazing.  Their energy and passion has been unrivaled.  \n\nSecondly, THANK YOU to Mike Mahoney for recording and uploading the show.  Your quality is stellar.  I am so grateful to the community of tapers who continue to exceed expectations with the quality of the music they share on archive.	jshkolnik	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-23 16:41:00-05
65855	12719	10	What a show.....	First and foremost a BIG THANKS to Gumby for doing this ! What a show, we all tried our best to "call the song" yet to no avail, nobody could guess this set list! The energy Bobby put out on stage was answered ten fold by the crowd, I have never seen him so animated, even "rowing" with his guitar during Row Jimmy, windmills, lunges, hip thrusts, even side by side with John, crazy man !	DEADPHR3D	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-23 19:57:55-05
65856	12719	8	another excellent show, getting better and better	1st - Thank You to the band, tapers, Archive uploaders & all else who help in putting this music out into the spheres to be heard again and again, around and around.  It's been a real joy to do an audio couch tour for Dead and Company 2015. Hopefully there's more than just the one webcast shown so far... probably New Year's. But again & especially to the tapers - Thank You.                                                                                        2nd -  As I drove down the road earlier today listening to a Spring 90 box set show from the Knickerbocker arena, I realized that I was listening to a show 25 years after it was played. And at that point, for that show and tour, The Grateful Dead had existed and been playing for 25 years.  Now I sit and listen to a Dead & Company show being played 25 years after the Spring 90 shows.  Both bands sound remarkably fresh and full of talent. They both can rock it fast or slow and play all kinds of jams in between. I really enjoy the reggae jams Dead and Company have been scattering through songs in certain shows.                                                                                               AS For this show I'll rate it at 4 & 1/2 stars for sound, musicianship, and a creative set list.	slavetothegroove	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-24 00:46:57-05
65857	12719	10	Wow.	That Dear Prudence was one the most beautiful things I've seen at a Dead show. Ate some paper and was a little too deep in my head during drums/space (who wouldn't be during that space on a tab...), and then Dear Prudence comes on. For those who don't know, Dear Prudence was written in Rishikesh, India by John Lennon for Prudence Farrow. They were all at a meditative retreat but Prudence was WAY too into it, didn't talk and was always in her head. The song was an appeal to snap out of it, get out of your head and enjoy the beauty. Nothing could have made me come out of my head quicker than that song, thank you Dead & Co... This band has known what to say for 50 years through song & music.

65858	12719	10	Amazing!	The show was everything I hoped it would be, and you captured it perfectly. Thank you, kind sir!	kbone	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-24 01:55:56-05
65859	12719	10	Cryptical	Great show.  The standalone Cryptical is pretty cool and full of passion.  Well done.	PaperCanoe1	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-24 02:04:08-05
65860	12719	10	Resonance & Vibrations!!	oh man..  re-listening to Drums > Space > Prudence, brings a smile to my face.  the vibration/resonance from The Beam was fantastic where i was sitting, getting lost in the space jam, then being grounded back to the arena again by Dear Prudence. Very beautiful experience.\n\nThe encore threw me for a loop! Being a kid (at 39.. LOL), I've never heard the last line: "You can borrow from the Devil/ You can borrow from a friend/ But the Devil'll give you twenty/ When your friend got only ten"  (that or i haven't listened to enough live shows to stumble across it.. yet. lol)\n\nNow i get to dig for the Jack'O'Roses version from hunter. Thanks for the enlightenment, Dead & Co!\n\nsome observations (from concert and tape), I noticed Mayer's vocals were a little soft/quiet. also from where i was sitting, the drums didn't come through like i thought (though i was sitting between center and stage left). not sure if that's Target arena, or the sound.	monitorhead	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-24 11:18:34-05
65861	12719	8	A great evening!!	An amazing evening on the whole. This was my daughters first show. After being exposed to the Dead and all forms of music her whole life, she was finally able to attend a show and boy was it worth the wait. The show had a little bit of everything the band, in its various incarnations,does well. \n\nIt was odd to hear folks talking during the breaks of the "John Mayer Band" taking the stage for the second set. I wasnt s sure what to make of the initial pairing, but Ifigured the guys knew what they were doing. John adds flavor to the band that is unique and refreshing. Like so many of the guests the GD had over the years, his addition creates a new sound that makes the songs play differently. Bob and Mickey were animated for sure and Oteil was grooving throughout, constantly dancing thru the music.\n\nFinally, listening to FOTD played acoustically to end a show harkened me back to the 70/80 acoustic runs. In the words of Robert Hunter, "These days will come again, but not for me". Glad to have been able to give my daughter the gift of a show and God Bless the Grateful Dead.	cac123	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-24 15:54:16-05
65862	12719	10	ROAD TRIP	I drove up from Illinois to catch this show with a Phish Head and I was really glad we made the Road Trip! I hadn't seen any of the orginal GD crew jam since The Last Show 20 years ago so this was a pleasant suprise at how well the D & Co sounded. The crowd in the Target Center had a good vibe and the music was inviting! I hope that they stick together for a while and I get a chance to see them again! Thanks Mike for sharing the show. I plan on listening to it with my Kids so they understand a bit of my joy in the Music.	Dandysan	2016-07-07 13:54:38-04	2015-11-24 19:55:39-05

65871	12722	8	Great pull	Excellent, very hot show, and this recording captures that. Sounds clearer on the recording than it did in my ears - and Jeff's mic stand was right behind me. Very good pull - of the 4 active sources of this show, several have very good sound, but this provides the real crisp, clear, bright ambience.	crimsonace	2016-07-07 13:54:39-04	2016-06-19 19:44:20-04

65876	12724	10	Much better!	Best recording of this show I've heard so far. I was blown away Mayer's Cold Rain & Snow solo when I saw it in person, but couldn't find a solid recording that really brought out the clarity (or the clarity of the whole show really.) You can really hear his "Texas Blues Man" style in that solo... and it fits perfectly. \nThanks for posting this and fulfilling my need of a miracle!

65890	12729	10	ON FIRE	This  lineup is becoming the best lineup I have heard of post Jerry.this is the fourth show into the summer tour and I feel this band is really starting to find its Groove. thank you so much for recording and sharing so promptly. all this music is rekindling my youthful spirit and brings back a flood of memories of touring in the eighties and nineties	gr8fulmatt	2016-07-07 13:54:40-04	2016-06-18 14:41:13-04
65891	12729	8	Above	Yeah, got to agree this is the closest they've come to the magic w/o Captain Trips. Mayer is doing a good job of blending Jerry's styles with his own and giving new life to the show.\n\nHope Bobby stays healthy and energized. Thanks a million for posting this so quick.	americanyid	2016-07-07 13:54:40-04	2016-06-18 14:57:29-04

65893	12731	8	ENVY!!!	Recording is well done: 4/5.\nI saw the 1st show of the tour in CLT,NC and am envious of this show as it features a very nice, but not perfect (which makes it better in my book) Jack Straw and a fine Box of Rain. You guys also enjoyed an encore which we in CLT were unable to as the venue has been encroached upon by various housing projects & so there is a hard 'end the show by 11pm rule'!! BOO!!!	scottlovett	2016-07-07 13:54:40-04	2016-06-25 20:56:05-04

65900	12735	8	Sounds great!	Great opening night for a band that's still so new and sorting itself out. Your recording sounds fantastic! Thanks for sharing the good times! Peace.	Grahamps	2016-07-07 13:54:41-04	2016-06-12 02:52:27-04
65901	12735	8	Best recording of D & C to date	Great show to kick off the new tour. First off to the taper- thank you for this upload which sounds so incredible. I have listened to most of the dead and conpany shows in this archive and many were of outstanding quality, but this in particular IMHO just is above all of the others. It captures the  sound of being at the venue with the palpable feel of the energy from the crowd, a combination  which  makes some rare aud tapes like this superior even to SBs. \n  As for the band- what a scorcher of a show. This tour promises to be monstrous. Saw them at msg last fall and was blown away. But they are now reaching new levels. John Mayer continues to simultaneously show his love and skillful understanding of this music while putting his own stamp on it-  taking the band and the songs in new directions. Jeff Chimenti's contributions are becoming a more integral part of the band's stretching out process in the tradition of keith and Brent but with a different style. Bob weir sounding great again with renewed energy, introducing more songs each show to the repertoire. The possibilities  are unlimited for this group. We are so fortunate to have the opportunity to hear this music come alive again. To the JM haters - open your ears and then get back on the bus. If you enjoy Grateful \nDead music go and see these guys. I'll be there at citi field June 25 and I can't wait!\n    Just one negative  I want to get off my chest. I mean I love billy and mickey-  but enough already  with Drums & Space. Am I the only one that just doesn't get it?  I would much rather  hear a couple of more songs or even more extended jamming. Set 2 started with an amazing  45 minute sequence of EOTW>Deal>EP with the crowd loving every minute. Instead of building on that groove and buzz ,the band walks off and the apparently  obligatory  20 minutes of Drums and space ensues. To me it's a lost opportunity  because I feel they lose the juice from the crowd and sometimes they get it backand sometimes not before the end of the show.  Why not try to keep the energy building throughout the entire set and to a final crescendo.	feuerfam4	2016-07-07 13:54:41-04	2016-06-12 06:34:12-04
65902	12735	10	One the Best Shows Ive ever seen	Great recording! I was sitting right behind the tapers. Were the guys closer to the stage or the other guy who was behind the other tapers?	jerryfan88	2016-07-07 13:54:41-04	2016-06-12 06:46:29-04
65903	12735	10	Two old farts...	This was the first show my old roommate and I have been to in 30 years.  In fact, the last show, Bobby was our age now!  Great to see them and hear the music that shaped a generation.  Thanks for the posting.	RIGGO-1121	2016-07-07 13:54:41-04	2016-06-12 16:28:21-04
65904	12735	10	Drums/Space	I'm sure i speak for many TrUe DeAdHeAdS......if we have to explain Drums/Space...Then maybe you are either too young and have never really gotten the true ExPeRiEnCe....or maybe you just need to be educated or just not say anything at all.  Drums/Space for the band and well as many of the ExPeRiEnCeD fans its a time to just really get into what they are putting out there and try to connect with the band on a whole other level (enhanced or not) and it gives each of the band members a chance to recharge.  A usual 2 1/2+ hour show if all played at one sitting is a lot for any performer let alone those in their late 60's early 70's.  You try sitting through the event and not hit the head at least one time let alone take a seat once or twice.  A recharge or just to be able to sit in the AC even just for 10-15 minutes makes a great deal in performance.  especially on these hot and humid summer days.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all 500+ times watching and listening to Drums/Space during the Jerry years and the past 21 years and additional 300+ shows  of the Other Ones, Phil and Phriends, RatDog, The Dead, Furthur, and now Dead and Company combined still enjoy the TRADITIONS of Drums/Space!  \nPeace and remember to always, LeT yOuR fReAk FlAg FlY!!!!

65908	12736	10	Thanks to all!/Best yet???	Thanks to those involved in the making and sharing of these recordings! I have enjoyed following this tour and so many others.\n\nJeff (and the band) really raised the bar on this one. Love it! I cannot honestly pick a favorite given the abundant variety, but this one sure seems like the best to me.\n\nThis is the standing in front of the stage sound I like to hear, and this was a great show. What if nobody taped the show? That would be awful. Thanks for being there!	GregAtlanta	2016-07-07 13:54:41-04	2016-07-04 16:20:31-04

65911	12737	10	Almost better than the show!	Wow, it's crazy hearing the few recordings from the same stand at the show! These mics seem most directly connected to the speakers, with very little ambient interference, despite picking up the music from almost exactly the same location as three other mic setups. I haven't listened all the way through in a single pass, but this recording may be the keeper, especially for someone who wasn't there, and isn't seeking to relive their sonic memory of this special tour kickoff.

65922	12743	10	Memories of Hartford	First off, really nice recording! \nBeing from Vermont, Hartford was always one of the closer shows to home and I went to as many as I could back in the day. The best time I had there had to be when they allowed us to camp for three nights on the State House lawn. How sweet was that? Remember when venues used to let us pitch tents for the two or three night runs in their cities? Gone are the days...\n\nFrom all of the shows I have been to and listened to since my brother gave me a Dead Show for a high school graduation present in 1983 (UVM show) and reset the trajectory of my life forever, there seems to be something very special about a lot of the Hartford shows. Jerry and the boys seemed to just fire on all cylinders there, and it appears that Bobby and his crew have done the same here. Still haven't listened to the entire thing yet, but so far this recording and this performance are treatin' me right. \n\nGreetings from Okayama, Japan! Tell the band we'd love to have them over here for a visit! There are a lot more Japanese Deadheads than people might imagine.\n\nBy the way, are there any Citi Field recordings out there? Or is there some reason those shows can't be posted?	markharrison	2016-07-07 13:54:42-04	2016-06-30 02:09:48-04
65923	12743	10	Great show!	Nice pull, Mark, and thanks for upping this. Mayer was extending his jams and producing some memorable moments. Bobby was present and energized. Jeff was excellent, and Oteil, Bill and Mickey were so solid. I was next to a young guy who had never experienced any iteration of the dead and he was blown away, as was the more experienced deadhead on my other side, who kept saying he couldn't believe what John had just done.	intpseeker	2016-07-07 13:54:42-04	2016-06-30 12:58:50-04

65934	12744	8	viola lee magic	the dynamic setlist really kept us on our toes, both in terms of pace and energy. the jam out of bird song was exceptional. loved the lost sailor > st. of circumstance in the opening slot of the 2nd set. the viola lee blues is just a monster force of blues playing and magic - absolutely must-hear stuff. terrapin station is my favorite dead tune, so hearing that after such an awesome viola lee was icing on the cake for me. the bust-out dear prudence brought smiles all around for everybody.\n\ni want to see this band so many more times	bmrobin	2016-07-07 13:54:42-04	2016-06-28 13:26:16-04

Good Job!\nThat said, the show opened with love and continued the whole way through, although I caught myself jumping during Deal and opened my eyes and John was jumping onstage in perfect synchronicity :0 !!! Holy moment of moments!!! So yeah the Deal smokes! The Estimated Growled, Space shook my sternum and Stranger in a second set!! YEAH!!! Wicked guitar work, amazing bass (Otiel is the JAM!!), keys floating through in perfection (Jeff is So On Point!) but, gotta say, my drummers were just Past awesome, beyond jazz through fusion and somewhere in the galactic range, like a perfectly synced asteroid belt just Crushing it!!!!  \n\nThanks to all For A Real Good Time!! \n\nDef worth a proper listen if you missed the show .)	1mtnhiker	2016-07-07 13:54:44-04	2016-06-11 08:45:32-04

65958	12755	0	Feels Like A Stranger?	You DO know the song is called Feel Like a Stranger, right? Not Feels? \n\nBecause clearly, he is saying "But still I....feel like a stranger", not "it feels like a stranger", which really makes no sense.\n\nCall me a nit-picker. I think it's important to know thi stuff.	nycityjeff	2016-07-07 13:54:44-04	2016-06-11 16:37:28-04
65959	12755	0	Dead and Company Live at PNC 6/10/16	Marty Loving, just starting to listen now...quality sounds great. SO GRATEFUL to you for this...it's gold for those of us who couldn't be at Dead and Company's Summer 2016 Tour kick-off concert and love this band and music more than words can tell! Thank you so very much! \n\n⚡️🌹💀💃🏻🎸⚡️\n\nMimi	Mimimph	2016-07-07 13:54:44-04	2016-06-11 18:12:42-04
65960	12755	8	HB2	Can't help but wonder if this setlist was tailored to fit the NC gender equality issue? Or maybe the music just speaks to us in ways that work for us at a given time... or maybe both. \n\nThanks for putting this up so quick. GF and I ended up in a debacle that prevented us from going to the show (being a grown up SUCKS). Thanks to today's technology we were able to FWD tix to a friend who miracle'd a couple in the lot.  \n\nAwesome lovelight improv about NC law and letting the  lovelight shine. \n\nThanks again for putting this up so fast. You made my night. Great sound for an audience recording,  limited talking Chad's in your mic, tix ended up in good hands, HB2 getting addressed on first show of tour = awesome	kaspen2	2016-07-07 13:54:44-04	2016-06-12 01:48:05-04

65963	12755	10	A few words for nycityjeff	Hi, Jeff. Instead of criticizing a simple typo, you might have said thank you to Marty for taking the time and energy and experience to post a great recording of what we all know to be incredible music. \n\nThank you, Marty, and all the other tapers for doing what you do to make this music available to us all. \n\nGreetings from the Japanese contingent of Deadheads!

65972	12757	10	Killer sets	I think that the whole band did an excellent job of playing at this show.  no doubt they are in the groove.. I wish I could have been there but I got tied up in Bangkok.  \nPeace and love for all those lucky souls who got to go to this show.	jaidee	2016-07-07 13:54:45-04	2016-07-05 17:36:14-04
65973	12757	10	Magic	Great set, great recording. Highlights were Not Fade Away and Fire on the Mountain. This show made me believe in John Mayer.	Kubrickan	2016-07-07 13:54:45-04	2016-07-05 19:18:03-04
65974	12757	0	Getting better all the time	I was listening to this show on the XM/Sirus Broadcast the other night. As unlikely as it may seem (in perhaps my mind only) to conceive that they would gel so well with Jon Mayer, that's exactly what is happening. \n\nThe two Boulder shows were incredible. As a long time head I have to say that this iteration of post Jerry Dead troupes is arguably the most interesting (note that I have not said the best, because that term pins the tunes into a box of subjectivity that I see all too many heads get stuck in, it's the music that continues to evolve through all who have decided to get on the bus). \n\nThat being said I was blown away with Bobby's singing of Tennessee Jed, haven't heard him reaching out of his vocal comfort zone to let Jerry breathe through his vocals in that manner before. I was completely mesmerized by the under played/under appreciated/barely known 'Even So'. Very fitting given the untimely demise of one of the most influential and amazing bassists, Rob Wasserman. I could overhear some fans (annoyingly) talking under the song, they didn't recognize it and thought it was a but depressing. But if they'd bothered to let things be w/o feeling as if they need to comment on things they do nit understand then I believe they would've appreciated it even more. The rest of the show was great. Thank you for posting this show. I hope these guys continue to brew up some more amazing music to keep the songs alive for a couple more decades.

65991	12759	10	What a show!	Thanks for capturing this, Keith!  Great quality, and for a guy who appreciates some crowd noise, this is perfect.  \n\nThis show shoots out of a cannon with Bertha->Shakedown->West LA, and after a breezy, summery handful of tunes, the 8' mark of The Wheel shifts this show to a whole other gear (don't sleep on the Playin' or the entire Wheel, mind you).	wayneheilala	2016-07-07 13:54:46-04	2016-06-24 03:18:34-04

65993	12760	8	Excellent 24 Bit Recording	I bought the 24 Bit SBD but this is quite nice.  Some of the other Citi recordings have been boomy and unclear. this is far better. \n\nGood work here	gotcds	2016-07-07 13:54:46-04	2016-07-06 21:58:50-04
65994	12762	8	makes me miss the 80s	They guys where connecting and playing awesome.  Bobs voice is spot on.   Meet some fun people but the new crowd act like idots. Wish they remember to  just be musicians and keep there political beliefs at home.  Think that is what made the crowd so different.	cbuilder	2016-07-07 13:54:46-04	2016-06-11 20:29:21-04

66006	12767	10	Jam!	The Jam coming out of Sid is amazing, wish I could have witnessed that one. Steve's arm's should have fallen off after pounding on the drums like that for 7 or 8 minutes... Yet another Lotus show that impresses me from start to finish. Wish they would make it up here to Mass sometime soon.	bleblanc	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2003-05-06 19:17:10-05
66007	12767	10	this is  a great show	This is the first Lotus show I ever heard! I was hooked as soon as I heard them. I highly recommend this show for a starting place to hear Lotus. They are a great band. I also had the pleasure of seeing them live in October in Iowa City, IA 10-21-03 show is another one I recommend as this is the show I saw	pharyjane1	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2004-01-29 21:36:00-05
66008	12767	10	I agree!	This was the 1st show I heard from these guys and it hooked me.  I highly recommend this show if you're a new listener or an old fan!	Captain_Kirk	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2004-03-09 13:36:37-05
66009	12767	10	Wow	Man I love the archive! I read about these guys on Amazon, looked em up on etree, sure enough there they were listed, looked up a highly rated show, and now I've found a great new band.\nThis band lays down some killer grooves and tight melodies, mellow at times and jammin at others. Plus it's dsbd sound. Definitely check this band out, and if you already have, this is a great show.	moe.ron111	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2004-08-06 13:20:25-05

66011	12767	10	Jammin	Tight sound as always.  DSBD is the way to go, you miss almost nothing. Check it out and be amazed.  These guys need to com around the midwest more often.  I cant wait to see them.	Deadgroove	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2005-05-12 15:06:26-05

66013	12767	8	OG	Great intro on SLOL and then the end of Sid>Jam is just waves of pacific ocean nights! Futureworld is the jam as well.	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2008-11-16 09:35:56-05
66014	12767	10	Tony Montana	Great show, like always.  Lotus just seems to pull out one amazing performance after another.  The sid jam made me feel like I was walking down Miami Beach with a pile of blow in my nostril... or was it the pile of blow in my nostril that made me feel like that???  Either way, that was some straight Tony Montana groove shit.	farone45	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2010-09-07 20:52:29-04

66016	12767	10	Thanks...	I'm an old fan of Lotus, but haven't listened to them for a while.  This show seems like a great one to get back into them with.  The recording sounds wonderful & I can't wait to listen.  Your hard work & effort don't go unappreciated...Keep up the good work!	Dickie2306	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2016-01-03 23:51:55-05

66021	12769	10	this show is money	Wow, this was the first show I d/l of Lotus.  Great listen, don't know too much about these guys, but slowly and surely getting to dig the sh** outta them.\n\nWell worth the download!	Northwoods Jake	2016-07-07 14:15:33-04	2007-04-02 04:13:45-04
66022	12770	10	Good show!	This is a good smooth sounding show.  I like the old sound just as much as I like their newer sound.  It seems in the old days the band just laid back, got into a groove and just jammed.  I like that.  I streamed this show while at work and I definitely enjoy it.	Captain_Kirk	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2005-07-05 08:40:48-05
66023	12770	10	This is where it's at!!!	I have been a Lotus fan for qutie some time.  I like what they've become, but what they were doing in 2002 was fantastic.  Raw, vivid, visionary, and tight within a warmer sbd sound.  This show has the vibe that you want.  Plus, I can see the venue in my mind's eye, for this show was played at my favorite place in my home town.	Nealiosporen	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2005-11-20 13:45:23-05
66024	12770	10	WOW!!  DAMN!!	This is an awesome sounding show! It is freakin crystal clear. I have really gotten in to Lotus and the tight ass smooth mellow grooves. These guys never disappoint!! Check it out, you wont be sorry!!!	dreamer1824	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2006-01-29 20:00:15-05
66025	12770	10	What?	I don't know what the hell just happened, but that was f*cking sick. The first couple tracks had me gone....	SpaceWrangler952	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2008-07-30 03:00:00-04

66028	12770	10	wow	i havent herd much of the early lotus this stuff is realy groovy the first couple tracks have a hip hop soul. the rest straight jammin, the sound is great no noise!	agratefulheadbiscuitphisher	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2009-01-23 03:23:11-05
66029	12770	10	Flies All Around	In case anyone out there hasn't noticed, Lotus is quickly becoming the hottest jam band on the scene.  I saw Lotus seven times this summer, and every show they got better and better.  They're a progressive band that has transformed their own style, and expanded their horizons.  Although they still have that incendiary groove that they were originally known for, check their new style -- they bring the groove and the rage.  Lotus has stepped it up, and I personally can't wait to see what they have in store for all of us.  Look at those flies all over Lotus; it's cause they're the shit people.	farone45	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2010-09-07 20:27:29-04
66030	12770	10	wow	god DAMN this show is awesome. old lotus is where it is at. in one way im kind of sad i missed all of these years since i just discovered them last summer, but i am so excited that all of these soundboards are here for me to enjoy and i have barely scratched the surface. thanks to whoever recorded this.	daver00lzd00d	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2012-12-23 10:17:11-05

66033	12771	10	Thank you!	Wow a 2002 Lotus recording I have never heard! And uploaded in the end of the year 2015! Thank you for this and if you have more old recordings/photos please upload:) ~lotusvibes~ 	jSweens	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2016-01-14 04:46:00-05
66034	12772	10	verrrrrry nice	mostly downtempo, soulful beats. perfect one-discer, for anybody who still burns this stuff. but I don't much anymore, which is why I am very thankful for the streaming option! 	Ha Ha Ha Whoops	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2007-07-31 01:24:39-04
66035	12773	8	whine much?	this tape sounds fantastic - i LOVE Lotus soundboards!! it does sound like the band is playing to about a dozen people, tops. but the worst part for me is the banter. first whining about the monitor mix (maybe they didn't soundcheck), then begging for people to dance, then cynically joking that they're going to cover a DMB tune, then kinda half-assing the merch pitch, etc. very ouch to my general ear area. i'll pick this one up again because the music selection and performances are absolutely spectacular, but i sorta wish the bitching sessions had been tracked out separately so i could fast forward. if this was my first time seeing the band, it would have probably been my last.\n\nLucky for me my first show kicked ass! See you on Cali tour in the fall! can't wait for Crystal Bay	Ha Ha Ha Whoops	2016-07-07 14:15:34-04	2007-08-23 16:19:17-04
66036	12774	10	Sick Show, tracks out of Order?	So, listening to this one and at the end of "Sid" (d2t4 - the final track) it's announced "Alright, uh, that one was called 'Sid', this is a fairly new one, it's called 'Flower Sermon'" - so it seems that the tracks were uploaded out of order.  Can anyone find an official setlist so we can rearrange these correctly?\n\nStill out of order or not, I have to give this one 5 stars.  I love this band, and I love the crispy recording.	Brad Leblanc	2016-07-07 14:15:35-04	2004-09-09 17:59:57-05
66037	12774	8	Setlist info	Great versions of all the tunes here! :-)\n\nSetlist and correct order for this show is as follows:\n\n09-04-02 Castaways, Ithaca, NY (WED)\n1: Nematode, My Own Personal 3-letter Word, Sid, Flower Sermon, Umbilical Moonrise\n2: Drums > Jam > It’s All Clear To Me Now, Greet The Mind, Shimmer And Out\nCo-billed with DJ Boywonder and Juniper\n\nTracked wrong here, though.

66038	12775	10	Fantastic!!!	This show has amazing sound!  The 24 bit recording is flawless!  Not to mention the show is super fun.  It's worth the large download once you hear it.  Also, fabulous mic placement...how on earth did you get that accomplished!!	suspect	2016-07-07 14:15:35-04	2003-07-02 08:01:28-05
66039	12775	10	Wonderful!	This is my first exposure to Lotus, and I've been listening to the show over and over. Simply fantastic!\nI am wondering about a 44.1/16 version, because I'd like to give it out to friends. Was there a pure 44.1/16 recorded, or will this be downsampled? (I downsampled in CoolEdit for my own needs, but want the "official" way before distributing)	juicer_digdug	2016-07-07 14:15:35-04	2003-08-06 05:31:12-05
66040	12776	10	shhh..it must be a secret	cuz this one's a lunker nugget that seems to be foolishly overlooked. not only does Founder's brew some of THE best IPA in the country (if you have one better, I'd LOVE to try it) they book heavy bands like Lotus to throw it down, thank you very much. \nonly need to say that this show is HEFTY. not sure if you begin a set any better than the LTJ jam. and greet the mind is so funked, I had to push pause and put on my fur before I could continue onward. \nI won't say anything else; if you don't have this....sorry.

66041	12776	10	Correct	You are correct my friend, Downloaded this one a long time ago and just came across it again now. You guys are sleeping on this one for sure. It's sick!!	SpaceWrangler952	2016-07-07 14:15:35-04	2008-11-06 23:17:49-05
66042	12776	10	5 stars	excellent show. the Nematode is epic. the good old days when Lotus brought the FIRE.	daver00lzd00d	2016-07-07 14:15:35-04	2013-07-12 04:42:02-04

66047	12780	8	1st Listened & Impressed	Downloaded this show by taking the suggestion of the featured artist.  1st the quality of the recording is excellent.  Secondly, these guys jam!  Right from the 1st cut, the band is in a definite groove with a flow that had me wanting to hear more.  Great Stuff!  I will definitely be recommending this to all of my like minded friends, and of course burning them samples because they are definitely going to want this!  Thanks!	scotchman	2016-07-07 14:15:36-04	2002-10-12 00:00:00-05
66048	12780	8	good stuff!!	pick this one up, not only is it a great recording, it is very fun to listen to.  Nothing groundbreaking, but I really like what this band is doing!  Definitely get it if you are into the Disco Biscuts, Particle, or similar stuff.  Actually I'm not a big Disco Biscuits fan, but I like this!	hornsby	2016-07-07 14:15:36-04	2002-10-14 00:00:00-05
66049	12780	6	like what i hear	although I normally have a lot of problems with sources that list Mini-Discs, this one is about as good as it can be (i.e. SBD)  \n\nlike this band a bunch, kinda like the dbs but more like sector 9 a few years ago.  the jam is definitely there.  enjoy!!	tito	2016-07-07 14:15:36-04	2002-12-10 00:00:00-05
66050	12782	8	Last show of 2002	Well the night started out with one of everyones favorites Nematode, it was my first time to Wilkes Barre. Lotus has a style that can be easily adjusted and mixed at any time and still come out strong getting the crowd to dance to whatever sounds come their way. The first set was nice and long. The second set has about three songs but it was 1:15am when they started, the beats kept coming from chuck, steve was right on the money with the drums, Luke played around with the synth a little bit more, Jesse played some impressive bass, there was excitement, and Mike just went at it agressively all night long on the guitar. I would have to say Suitcases and Sandwiches, l'immeuble, and Flower Sermon were great.	Busgroove	2016-07-07 14:15:37-04	2003-05-15 10:28:11-05

66055	12783	6	Yin & Yang	Great show but the sound is not well equalized and there's a crackle/buzz in the right channel. 3*'s because of the sound.  Probably not worth the download.	Nealiosporen	2016-07-07 14:15:38-04	2005-12-10 18:36:29-05
66056	12784	8	Two-Hearted for what Ales ya!	This one gives you it's own mellow, hoppy buzz, just like the Two-Hearted Ale from Bell's Brewery.  There is indeed a mellow trance to this show, but there is also filthy funk at times.  These are the two hearts of this show. WORD! Sound: crispy, bassy, & a little low on the volume...still sounds great and worth the grab>>phatty songlist!	Nealiosporen	2016-07-07 14:15:38-04	2005-12-10 18:23:12-05
66057	12785	10	the sweet sound of Lotus	first time I heard these guys. not sure why there's only a handful of directory views, this show's a keeper. nice sbd, great show, turned me on for good. get this one, period.	MI_blueberries	2016-07-07 14:15:39-04	2004-09-17 10:18:31-05
66058	12785	10	Feelin' the Lotus vibes, dude	Only recently have I known who Lotus was, and only because of a rockin' friend. I was able to see them in my home town of Bozeman which was great 'cause the venue was small and intimate so I was right up front. Ever since then, I have been downloading differnt shows of theirs and I was amazed on the talent that this Philly band has. I am hooked and can't wait to see them live again.\n\nJammin' in MT	Grateful Forever 2	2016-07-07 14:15:39-04	2007-01-08 01:29:48-05
66059	12785	10	awesome	this is already an awesome show and im only on the second track. the livingston storm is one of the best ive ever heard. i miss the way they used to jam back in 02, their jams were so spacey and beautiful. definitely download!	daver00lzd00d	2016-07-07 14:15:39-04	2013-02-09 07:54:17-05

66061	12787	10	Grrrreat!	Simply put, this SHN set is great. If you dig Lotus, do yourself a favor and grab this recording. \n\nIf you don't know Lotus, start here.\n\n-Brad	bleblanc	2016-07-07 14:15:40-04	2002-12-19 14:24:55-05
66062	12787	10	Pleasant Surprise...	Got tipped off to this one via the staff picks, what a treat!!! Very loose, cool jams. Dreamy in some spots, jamming in others.  Sounds like largely improvised tracks, these guys are definitely high on the watch list.  Totally worth checking out if you are into long instrumental jams that really go somewhere.  Hope you like it!	Captain Video	2016-07-07 14:15:40-04	2003-01-05 19:40:06-05
66063	12787	10	Smooooooooooth Funk	Downloaded this since it was a "Staff Pick" having never heard of the band - what a treat!! Kind of like Kimock crossed with '98 Phish and then turn the mellow dial up a notch. Very nice.\n\nKickass recording, great show, you'll love it!	rheros	2016-07-07 14:15:40-04	2003-01-13 08:47:51-05
66064	12787	10	Great Introduction	As the title implies, this was my first exposure to this band. I am thoroughly impressed, both by the show itself and the quality of the recording. Absolutely great! Crisp, clear and clean sound. The only minus might be the almost total lack of crowd ambiance, which isn't always a bad thing with a show like this w/ a lot of "ambient/trance" moments.\n\nDefinitely pick up this show!	kpita	2016-07-07 14:15:40-04	2003-06-19 16:56:27-05
66065	12787	4	Not the best	I have a few Lotus shows and i saw them live in Charlotte. If you want a show to get you into this band, go to the show from 2/8/2003. its one of the best i've ever heard	Jam Sandwich	2016-07-07 14:15:40-04	2004-03-09 12:48:06-05

66068	12793	10	Tracked Soundboard	Great recording with some of my favorite Lotus tunes. I give it five for the songs and the amount of time they had.	manx	2016-07-07 14:15:42-04	2004-02-09 13:33:31-05
66069	12793	10	Great Deal	short, sweet, intense. fave ball of energy. full five	Ha Ha Ha Whoops	2016-07-07 14:15:42-04	2007-08-23 17:59:56-04
66070	12794	10	Great Show 4 First TIME LoTus Listeners!!!!	If you are a first timer, listen to this show!  It sounds great all for the bass being low and a little muddy but it seems to be like that on most of the sbd recordings from lotus.\n\nIf you like the new deal but think they are too house at times or if you like STS9 but think they are a little too trance at times, LOTUS is for you.  Lotus does a great job of adding warm guitar improvizations with a house/trance/funk type of groove kinda like STS9 or the new deal but different.  \nLotus improvizes a great deal and they are a very tight unit as well.  I can really hear a lot of freedom in Lotus's music.  While with STS9 (they may be tight sounding) they just don't "jam" enough for me.  And while the new deal may jam (and are really sweet at the house jams)they just seem one dimesional in the sense that they mostly stick to house beats/grooves. Lotus really blends a lot of different styles very well.  Not to mention that the drummer is a freakin human beat machine!  Lotus is leading the trance/house jam band scene eventhough there are many worthy coleaders.  The thing is not many people know about these guys, its a shame.\nSo DL, then review it and spread da word|\n\nI am excited to see what Lotus will bring in 2004 and beyond....	mistergyro	2016-07-07 14:15:42-04	2003-12-29 07:54:30-05

66075	12802	10	Great sound	I've listened to many recordings that were supposedly "awesome sounding" recordings.  This is one that really delivers. Clear like crystal, the taper had quality equipment, good job, thanks.  The jams are hypnotizing. I dig Lotus, many seem not to understand. I have entered the world without numbers...	ejanuska	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2007-04-12 19:33:34-04

66078	12802	10	Classic Lotii	Along with agreeing with everything mentioned in previous reviews, I have to say that this show is an absolute gem in the stash of Lotus AUDs.\n\nClassic stuff from the period and the approach that first turned me on to this band!  This show should be downloaded 67,000 times rather than that Stone Church show.\n\nThanks for sharing this recording!	H.B. Woodrose	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2010-03-03 18:21:21-05

66083	12802	10	Their music has	Evolved so much since 2003 and I think the first time I saw them was all good festival 2004 , 05 , 06 or 07 and to see how much they've grown is amazing	DustTizzle	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2016-01-25 13:10:40-05
66084	12803	8	awesome show, poor tagging	mistagging abounds, but the quality/playing is awesome. sweet, sweet lotus. and the moma dance teases in the sid are great.\n\ni've tried to piece together the correct setlist...I included the time signatures since all the songs are mistagged...where I wasn't sure about the names, I put a question mark:\n\nSet 1:\n1. Floating Amidst (beginning cut) (4:04) (?)\n2. Sift (13:35) (?)\n3. Soma (17:32)\n4. Greet the Mind (15:04)\n5. Umbilical Moonrise (13:46)\n\nSet 2:\n1. Drum 'n' Bass Jam (15:50) (?)\n2. Intro to a Cell (13:21)\n3. Sid (12:26)\n4. Shimmer and Out (7:11)\n5. Banter (0:29)\n6. Banter (1:18)\n7. Suitcases and Sandwiches (11:58)\n\nanyway, if someone knows the truly correct setlist, please post 'er.	nksmith	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2006-10-02 18:35:11-04

66087	12804	10	WOW	Probably the best $10 I've ever spent.  Crystal clear quality and great setlist.  Spiritualize is a highlight. Come back to NC soon!	NCSUtribefan	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2004-02-12 17:58:39-05
66088	12804	10	Excellent show!	This show is great.  It starts off kind of slow.  Once they get close to midnight they start to pick it up.  Then after the countdown...."Spiritualize"!!!  What a great song!  That's when they start to take off.  The rest of set 1 is great.  Set 2 is just fantastic from start to finish!  I highly recommend this show.  This band is going places!	Captain_Kirk	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2004-03-01 02:05:54-05
66089	12804	10	Crystal Clear !!!	YOu can hear everything Crystal in this recording.  GEt it now ! peace	Triggin	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2004-06-24 13:11:45-05

66092	12804	8	Solid	Pretty standard Lotus show - but w/ some NYE flava.  IMO Lotus was in a little valley from Winter'03 - Summer '05 - but they still are/were better than 90% of the crap out there.  One of the better shows from this period! \nHttp://Flowfeel.com	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2006-02-26 16:16:12-05
66093	12804	10	TIGHT!	GREAT sound quality--thanks to the band for these SBD recordings. being able to hear those supa funky basslines. great performance too. "plant your root" is sick!	psychedelicbrian	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2008-04-14 08:08:50-04
66094	12804	10	sick lotus	love this show!!!  i got the sbds from jesse on disc way back in the day but lost em years ago.  feels like coming home to listen to this.  the 'plant your root' is ridiculous, possibly the best ever.  'spiritualize' makes its first appearance and 'caywoode' sounds so good.  thanks lotus for this show.  	muserocket	2016-07-07 14:15:45-04	2011-08-15 23:41:53-04
66095	12807	10	Awe Yeah!	Wow! what a show.  What little I have heard of this band just keeps getting better.  So smooth and fun to dance to, it's hard not to be feeling this performance.  With out a doubt, if your at all into some of these newer progressive jam bands, Lotus is a must.  They touch all the bases. This show is a perfect start.  The recording is crystal clear and the vibes are high.  Enjoy!	schmitt68	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2003-04-09 15:39:32-05
66096	12807	10	Begin your Lotus collection here....	This show absolutely ROCKS. The jam and funk they blend with their ambeint/dance sound is great and the recording is very good sound quality with lots of crowd noice ....CHEERIN'em on.  \n\nHot stuff - get it.

66098	12807	10	Best of the Best	I have a few Lotus shows and i saw them live in Charlotte. If you want a show to get you into this band, download this one. very good soundboard matrix with the crowd. This recording gives you exactly what you hear live, including the stage fixes and such. excellent show, download NOW	Jam Sandwich	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2004-03-09 12:45:15-05
66099	12807	2	1st listen then burn cd	At least the last 10 minutes of set 3 (starting in lotus2003-02-08d3t05.wav, i.e. 6 min 11 sec in this track) are absolutely distorted - my ears did not stand listening to the end and so did may ear phones. I am sad that this show got 5 stars and I burned it to several discs without controlling the sound quality (my fault). I started with set 3, cannot tell anything about the rest of the show - sorry I had to write this first).\n\nRegards	Grafzahl	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2004-04-30 09:14:38-05
66100	12807	10	Awesome Awesome Show	Yeah the last few songs are distorted but besides that, the sound quality is great and most importantly, the band plays an amazing show.  I give it five stars.  Does anyone know a way to cut distortion out of an mp3 file?	Smalkmus	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2004-10-23 19:48:59-05
66101	12807	10	Groovy	My brother recommended Lotus, and this show reveals why. Very groovy: got me dancing in the kitchen (which is not always easy to do). The sound is not a problem at all.	octothorp	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2004-11-08 19:44:51-05
66102	12807	10	This is one of Lotus's most entrancing shows!	Jam packed crowd - bittersweet night - even though it was short lived and the music, heck yeah, the music!	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2005-02-15 09:24:00-05
66103	12807	8	Get it now!	While there is some distortion in the last few tracks, I apparently didn't find it as nearly as obstrusive as others. Overall, the show is as clear and crisp live recording as you will find. The performance is stellar and entrancing. Very highly recommended.	kpita	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2005-05-27 08:17:42-05
66104	12807	10	Beautiful....	Lovely show; gets all my friends dancing - in the kitchen, the yard, the car...\n\nTry it on an airplane, high over the mountains.	Sunwings	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2005-07-19 15:26:18-05
66105	12807	8	Great show but...	Everybody giving this show five stars seems to have not listened to the distortion on disc three. I think most reasonable reviewers would agree that a five star show should be perfect or close to it -a whole bunch of distortion should keep any show from earning the highest rating. That said, one can easily burn set one onto a disc and have a complete set of high quality music. If you're new to Lotus, I suggest that you first download 1-9-02, Billy's, Grand Rapids, MI (digital soundboard) and 11-24-04, The Brass Lantern, Reading, PA. These are two excellent sounding shows that don't have any significant flaws.	jedimastermojave	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2005-07-31 11:18:59-05

66107	12807	8	Nice Show	This is a great recording although the bass is a little quiet. The Umbilical Moonrise sounds a lot like the one on Germination although I cant be for sure.	funkin a	2016-07-07 14:15:46-04	2010-05-03 19:58:08-04

66119	12813	10	Very nice old school gem	Patient, jazzy improv highlights this old school Lotus gem.  Very chill, exploratory show.  Great versions of Did Fatt, Jump Off, Suitcases and It's All Clear to Me Now. \n\nI would highly recommend checking this one out.  \n\nAmazing to hear how much their sound has progressed!	groovintoSCI	2016-07-07 14:15:49-04	2009-05-20 17:10:57-04
66120	12813	10	ace	groovintosci pretty much covered it. very good show, starting with one of the best Sifts ive heard and closing it out with great Cissy Strut. this  show definitely deserves it's 5 star rating. big thanks to whoever recorded and uploaded it; now it can never die :] if only they still played this way.	daver00lzd00d	2016-07-07 14:15:49-04	2013-05-24 00:47:37-04
66121	12815	10	You Need This Show!!	What a great recording of a fine show, I love these guys and I really dig the DJ stuff as well.  It was last year's Beardslee Castle show that turned me on to Lotus and they have most definitely grown as a unit since I first heard them several months ago....lotsa fun, good grooves...enjoy!!	Captain Video	2016-07-07 14:15:49-04	2003-08-04 00:32:19-05
66122	12815	10	EPIC Lotus	First of all, I have to agree with everything Captain Video said below.  That being said, this show is everything I think of when Lotus comes to mind AND MORE.  The DJ intro is heat, and the band takes off immediately with Nematode.  The performance of every song is flawless, and these jams are unprecedented by today's Lotus standards.  If this show included a Flower Sermon, it would be THE quintessential Lotus show.  This is a dream setlist, a dream recording, and just an all-around dream show.  Thanks so much!!!!\n\nAlso, Track 5 is just labeled Sunrain, but it is actually "It's All Clear to Me Now > Sunrain."  Which just makes the show all the more nasty!	chapelphish	2016-07-07 14:15:49-04	2008-11-26 17:54:09-05
66123	12815	10	HIss	I have to agree with everyone else this is strait up fire. There is some hissing noise but I found out that if I turn down the treble the sound goes away so this is DEFINETLY worth the download.	funkin a	2016-07-07 14:15:49-04	2011-01-23 23:16:29-05
66124	12815	8	House	Most like house music I think I've heard from Lotus, probably just because of the DJ.  Good show, nice recording.	KFarone45	2016-07-07 14:15:49-04	2011-03-21 20:35:20-04
66125	12815	10	Lotus. Organic.Ambient.Trance.Funk	To the below reviews, this is old school lotus at its finest. Not just because the DJ was there, but in general this was there direction in the beginning years that developed with new ideas, and different sounds which start coming about. I will post and older lotus show if I can find it for dated 10-25-2002. Enjoy. Also working on reducing the hissing.	Busgroove	2016-07-07 14:15:49-04	2016-04-05 05:30:19-04

66135	12820	10	Holds up	This show is still tight!  Wrote the review as Flowfeel 5 yrs ago and this is still one of the best Lotus shows on Archive!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:15:51-04	2009-04-07 05:15:14-04
66136	12820	10	classic lotus!	was searching for a futureworld and this show came up. this is one of the first sound boards ive heard of lotus and im very impressed. this show is fire to say the least. love the space funk lotus used to bring to the table back in the early 2000's. check this show out	dirock89	2016-07-07 14:15:51-04	2012-02-11 16:23:09-05
66137	12821	10	Yes yes y'all	After a 9 month gap, seeing these guys again was like a blind man seeing a naked Halle Berry as his first visual.  Vast improvement as they continue to do!	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:15:51-04	2005-02-16 21:58:27-05
66138	12821	10	An emusic "EXCLUSIVE!" LOL	This VERY SAME recording is available for download AT A PRICE at http://www.emusic.com/album/10836/10836116.html in MP3 format.  I download these SHN files, converted them to MP3 and it's EXACT - not a different recording of the same show, but THE SAME recording that is for sale on emusic.  So of course, it is VERY WELL recorded and I don't have to tell any Lotus fan the music is AWESOME, so I won't attempt to describe Lotus music. MY important point here is THIS IS A TOP QUALITY RECORDING that is actually for sale on a commercial WEB site.  For those of you who have never converted SHN to MP3, Get FOOBAR 2000.  Great Recording, Great Band, Great Show, Great Music, etc, etc.!!!!!	MDProgger	2016-07-07 14:15:51-04	2006-11-06 01:56:13-05

66140	12822	10	Up and coming greatness	These guys are really on fire, and it's showcased in this show, Bubonic Tonic is a really good new song, the highlight was Greet the mind>umbilical moonrise...Rocky Theme was cool to, the sound quality is pretty darn good, i'd give it an 8.5, overall the show gets a 9.	umdhick	2016-07-07 14:15:52-04	2004-09-26 14:10:33-05
66141	12822	10	OH YEAH!!!	This is BY FAR the best Lotus show I have seen yet!!! They have really come a long way!!! Lookout everyone cause they were on fire!!! This show has TRULY made me a fan!!!	Launchpad421	2016-07-07 14:15:52-04	2004-09-26 20:08:14-05

66145	12824	10	This show is a must download!	This show is must-hear for several reasons: \n\n#1) The excellent sound quality of the matrix recording. The keyboard in Flower Sermon moves back and forth from one channel/speaker to the other - with headphones on, your brain will melt when you listen to this. \n\n#2) The Bubonic Tonic to open the second set. This signature Lotus tune now joins Travel and Spiritualize as the top three in thier reportoire, in my opinion. \n\n#3) The guest appearance of keyboard wizard Michael Christie. \n\nDownload it now!

66147	12824	8	setlist error	Hey the Space In Between Jam is actually SID or sid jam but a sick one at that. like thats theres funkiest song but in this one they amp it up a notch	strngchsewht	2016-07-07 14:15:55-04	2005-11-29 23:54:12-05
66148	12824	10	Spectacular Showing!	This is a beautiful representation of 2004 Lotus.  Setlist starts off a little slow, but by the time Flower Sermon and Opo drop, you know the place is going crazy!  The Bubonic is certainly one of the best they've ever played, as previously mentioned.  The latter part of the show is also extremely psychedelic thanks to Christie, who is now a member of Telepath.  And in response to the previous comment, Space in Between is in fact a composed song, though it is well jammed on here, not a Sid jam.  It's from the VERY early days of Lotus.  Many thanks to all involved!	chapelphish	2016-07-07 14:15:55-04	2009-10-15 03:16:36-04
66149	12825	10	Good show, bad tracking	This show is tracked incorrectly. All the songs are off by one when compared to the actual setlist.	The Lung	2016-07-07 14:15:56-04	2004-12-24 19:59:02-05

66154	12826	6	Great show but problems with the recording	While I am greatly appreciative of the effort that went into recording, transferring, and uploading this show, the effort is somewhat marred by a tracking error and a loud glitch. \n\nThe former refers to the beginning of Spiritualize being cut off and tacked onto the end of Eye of the Tiger. The tracking should be adjusted for disc 2, tracks 4 and 5 to rectify this error. The end of Disc 2, track 4 (Eye of the Tiger) should occur somewhere between 2:15 and 2:42. After making the split, the remainder should be associated with the beginning of Disc 2, track 5 (Spiritualize)\n\nThe latter refers to a VERY LOUD anomaly at 4:54 in Disc 2, track 5. (Spiritualize) It occurs in both the .mp3 and .flac versions and is quite distracting.	The Lung	2016-07-07 14:15:56-04	2005-01-17 12:15:49-05
66155	12826	6	where's my sbd??	i, too appreciate the effort the taper put into it.  i was seated right next to him for the first bit of the show, and there were a few really ridiculous drunk girls talking REALLY loudly for part of it.\nthe band was on fire.  we were there to see lotus and they didn't disappoint.  the jams wherein the drummer and percussionist switched places, and when brothers past's drummer joined them were SO GOOD - ahh...\nalas, the recording ain't all that.  what i love about lotus is the soundboard love, and i'd love to make a "matrix" mix of this and a sbd of it, but in the meantime i'll have to make due with my new years memory preserved with the aud.  the 3 is for the recording, not the band.	thisistao	2016-07-07 14:15:56-04	2006-03-21 14:13:00-05
66156	12827	10	LOTUS SOUNDBOARD	Super solid one-disc soundboard! Be sure to check out the picture files too -- and the hot version of "Spiritualize"!	Dgold at AHT	2016-07-07 14:15:56-04	2004-05-17 03:11:32-05

66157	12827	8	good set	I really like these guys.  They remind me a lot of signal path.  The sound is crip and tight and the jams are sweet.  The fade out/cut in the first track is not so great though.	joyfulsnd	2016-07-07 14:15:56-04	2005-04-16 17:05:08-05
66158	12828	8	The show that turned me on!	Went to the Troc to see Bros. Past (whose set I ended up leaving, just didn't do it for me...) and caught most of this set. What a great band! The set had a real flow to it, and left the crowd very happy indeed. Thanks to Chris, now I get to enjoy it again! :)	willdawg	2016-07-07 14:15:57-04	2004-05-13 18:23:23-05
66159	12830	8	songs	Song 2 is Intro To a Cell part 1, New Song is Blue Giant, Song 6 is Philly Hit. i dont know what the first song is. good show and quality, thanks for recording! :D	daver00lzd00d	2016-07-07 14:15:58-04	2013-02-19 23:36:06-05

66163	12832	10	amazing	best quality sounding lotus show on the llama to date 10/7.  recommend downloading, buring to cd and cranking the bass all the way on your cd player  !!!!  enjoy	funky_j	2016-07-07 14:15:59-04	2004-10-06 18:52:16-05
66164	12832	8	Nice show	This show has great sound for an audience recording, but it is by no means the best sounding show on the archive.  There are other very sweet sounding soundboards that allow for a more full appreciation of the beautiful Lotus sounds.  This set is a nice set of tunes, worth the download for sure.	moe.ron111	2016-07-07 14:15:59-04	2005-02-06 12:14:04-05
66165	12832	10	Short but sweet	This set is just over an hour long -- making it perhaps a good way to try a first taste of Lotus. And it's not short because they don't extend and develop the tunes to the full. Super sound, too. With repeated listens over the last year, this has become one of my favorite shows.	octothorp	2016-07-07 14:15:59-04	2005-10-04 11:46:19-05
66166	12833	10	Thanks for this old school Mr. Small's recording!	Great show.  Corrections:\nTrack 1 is "Sift" not "Stift".\nTrack 6 is "opo".	nirradical	2016-07-07 14:15:59-04	2015-08-27 06:32:52-04
66167	12834	8	Don't be afraid	This is a good show, I think nobody's downloading it because no one has reviewed it. Good sound quality, choice songs, all pretty long. Only beware- the setlists (both the one that comes on the tracks as you download them AND the one shown above) are wrong. It took me a while, but I got it figured out. Correct setlist:\n1. Nematode\n2. Suitcases and Sandwiches\n3. Gemini Conspiracy\n4. Spiritualize >\n5. Dark Brown Earth\n6. Jump Off\n7. Plant Your Root\n8. Sunrain\n9. Opo\n\n(Spiritualize and Dark Brown Earth are NOT on the same track, and there is no Flower Sermon.)\n4 stars out of 5 simply because of the track-changing labor that comes with downloading the show.

66168	12836	10	lotus at stella blue	we stopped by this show on our way on a fantastic great american road trip.  they're great, and they were pretty on this night.  i hadn't seen them before, only heard the album, and i was not at all disappointed.  they throw down a pretty phat show, mixing somewhere between funk and an electronic jamband sound (which i think would be great opening up for sound tribe sector 9, myself).  it was a really good show, not much of a crowd, and you can't go wrong with the soundboard clarity.  i haven't heard the recording yet, so no comments there, but i'm downloading it now, and i'll let you know.  peace.  rating reflects having only heard it live, not the recording.	opiejuan	2016-07-07 14:16:00-04	2004-07-05 10:30:58-05

66172	12838	10	thanks carl	thanks carl. this was such a great show. not too many people showed up (maybe because it was at the bayside grange, maybe because it was the week of midterms at hsu), but those that did enjoyed a magical show.

66179	12839	10	Growing Fanbase	Warning!!!  I Like To Ramble.....\nI decided to give this band a try after I read a few comments on the message boards about how good they were.  No Disappointment!!  I chose this particular show based on the other reviews it received, and this was a PERFECT introduction to Lotus.  After streaming the show at first, I decided it was time for a late nite download/burn session.  After typical computer problems, it turned into a much later night than I had planned on.\n\nMorning conversation at work the following day.\nBoss: You're late.\nMe: Uh, yeah.\nBoss: Up late again?\nMe: Uh, yeah.\nBoss: That damn Archive again?\nMe: Uh, Hell Yeah.\nBoss: I figured.\nMe: Here ya go.(holding out freshly burned Lotus show)\nBoss: What the....\nMe: Just listen to it.\nBoss: Well...Okay.\n\nLater that same day.\nBoss: Holy Smokes. What did you say this band's name was again.\nMe: I didn't. It's Lotus. Now, can I have my CD back?\nBoss: Sure, just make me one.\nMe: No Problem.\n\n5 stars all the way around on this one.  Great musicianship, excellent sound, and super job by the taper. Kudos!!\n\nTHANKS ARCHIVE\nAnd an extra special Thanks to other reviewers who help direct and guide some of us people that have been in the dark far too long.

66180	12839	10	The Sound Of Life	Ah, Lotus.  They are truly the purveyors of vitality in audio form.  This show did not disappoint, and as always (at Lotus shows, at least) I danced till I dropped.  I'm pleased with the sound quality in this one.\n\nDoes anybody happen to have a recording of the show that Lotus did in Club 156 (on CU-Boulder campus), a day or two before this one?  It's an off chance, I know, but it was possibly the best Lotus show I have ever been to...	Sklangdog	2016-07-07 14:16:01-04	2005-05-31 22:58:48-05
66182	12840	10	bringin it...	these guys bring it hard every fuckin night! nice sbd here, worth it alone for the sick, nasty opo-funk dropped on disc 1. solid from start to finish, check this one out if you haven't yet.	MI_blueberries	2016-07-07 14:16:01-04	2004-09-17 10:11:31-05

66184	12842	8	Great Recording!	Great recording Matt, thanks for getting this one out so quick! Real crisp recording, sounds much warmer than the soundboard recordings. Hope more folks bring their mics to Lotus shows, the SBD's are nice, but they can't compete with a nice warm Audience pull in my opinion. \n\nJust one note, there's a few digiglitches that could use looking at:\nd2t2: 07:28, 10:19 \nd2t4: 14:24\n\nMight want to take a look at fixing and uploading replacement tracks eventually.\n\n-Brad	bleblanc	2016-07-07 14:16:01-04	2004-03-01 13:54:02-05
66185	12842	8	setlist meh	I'm gonna see if anyone on Lotusvibes.com forum knows the setlist for this. d3t1 is Umbilical Moonrise, I believe, and it is hot. Thanks to Matt the taper for nice quality recording and prompt upload.  It has a nice room sound that is perfect for the aero Lotus styles. Adding setlist is my only suggestion to improve this offering.	Dgold at AHT	2016-07-07 14:16:01-04	2004-03-04 02:31:53-05
66186	12842	10	setlist	If your looking for some music to listen to at work this is alsome first time I have heard of them. Im only on the secound track of this show and I know Im going to get some more. They call the music organic ambient trance funk. And it rocks.

66190	12844	10	Bass hit	I totally agree about the extremely high quality of this show -- and the recording. It's especially good at balancing all the players, and so it's easy to hear here what a huge piece the bass is to Lotus.	octothorp	2016-07-07 14:16:02-04	2004-12-06 08:26:51-05
66191	12844	10	Comes out like a Shadow	Just like a lot of Lotus gigs this one wraps you up early w/o you even realizing it and then bounces you along like mad.  Maybe it is the sound quality or maybe it was the show, but you are able to hear some major experimentation in this show.  Top notch!	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:02-04	2005-03-13 18:34:36-05

66196	12848	8	SETLIST	04-17-04 Trocadero Theater, Philadelphia, PA (SAT)\n\nPlant Your Root, Intro to a Cell, Sunrain, Ball Of Energy, Lucid Awakening, Dark Brown Earth, Jump Off, Spiritualize\n\nCo-billed with Brother's Past, DJ Boywonder opened	HARP	2016-07-07 14:16:02-04	2016-03-13 20:27:55-04
66197	12849	10	Ragin' in Richmond	I have to say that the energy in Alley Katz for Lotus on March 6th 2004 was out of this world. The crowd was appropriately grooving and the band was laying it down. This is a great onstage recording, it is very bassy but it doesn't sacrafice any other instrument while being bass heavy. Many other Lotus recordings I have heard don't have any low end in them. This one does, so if you are looking for a lotus recording with a little more punch to it I would highly suggest downloading this show. Around 300 people at the show. Disc 2 is hands down the best Lotus stuff I have heard to date.	dancinbarefoot1	2016-07-07 14:16:02-04	2004-04-19 07:44:24-05

66201	12853	10	Great show, great recording	Great job with this one G!  Thanks for making it available, I'm sure this one will be popular just for the source alone, but also because it was previously unavailable to most.  Ha ha!	fUNKYbret	2016-07-07 14:16:04-04	2005-02-13 08:58:30-05

66204	12854	8	Japan	Great Show, thanks for the DL! \n\nJust wonderin' if anyone has heard (or even ATTENDED) any of the Japan shows?  Any chance these might make it to archive.org?	ViolaLee	2016-07-07 14:16:04-04	2005-10-10 07:18:08-05
66205	12854	8	Nice	That's a sick show. Thanks a lot for taping these. Lotus is incredible	Theo123	2016-07-07 14:16:04-04	2006-04-26 22:58:49-04
66206	12854	2	timewarp	there is no way that the first set is at the correct speed; slowed down a couple of notches at least, very hard to listen to. second set, speed fixed, but still a talky aud, good band effort but clearly a tour warmup. disc three still worth listening to once. one gold star for the effort, thanks for making it\n\npsyched for shows out west this month!

66208	12855	10	AUD recording?!	Lotus seems to be a difficult band to tape.  the majority of archived recordings i've heard tend to lose Jessie (Bass guitar) or only caputre his low end necessitating EQ adjustments to get a full, rich soundfield.  However, this pull completely captures jessie's full range, the whole band for that matter. in fact, if one could not see the source info, this could easily be mistaken for a SBD or Matrix.  Kudos!!!!  \n\nedit:  DUH...onstage mics!	jloh	2016-07-07 14:16:05-04	2005-12-22 13:00:47-05
66209	12855	8	Enjoyed it	Great taping by Grider. Love to get him back and taping more shows! A definative show from this era of Lotus. Love the "Crazy Train" tease which might be the first time this came out live. Of course now its been on setlists more and more. 	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:16:05-04	2010-12-03 01:23:48-05
66210	12856	8	Very Nice - Breakout coming?	These guys just need to bust out of that STS9 flow and go it there own way.  While all-&-all the 2 sounds are so different - as a disciple of both bands - you can still feel the stark similarities.  This show displays Lotus in top form - impressive after rockin' the crowd the night before.  Lotus is fluffy and fun, that's this sets message and when Lotus is at its best.

66216	12859	10	thanks Jeff and Jamie>	this is a damn fine recording of what sounds like a complete party of a Lotus show, wish I had been there, five star recording and show, I'll be recording several of the upcoming midwest Lotus shows so watch for them to be posted here, Grider	Grider	2016-07-07 14:16:08-04	2005-08-28 16:43:45-05
66217	12859	10	Decent recording of the best show EVER	This show was substituted in place of Sound Tribe Sector 9 and it was the first night of Wakarusa.  The crowd was insane and lotus definately put out an amazing sound and vibe.  Definately worth downloading.	jamminjason	2016-07-07 14:16:08-04	2005-08-29 14:12:29-05
66218	12859	10	Lotus Lotus Lotus	This band saved my night after I walked away from a lame ass Umphrey's Show the first night of Wakarusa. It was the first time I ever heard Lotus and I am absolutely addicted now. If you like STS9, or SCI when they are real trancey, you will really dig this band. Funky as hell, ya can't help but dance. Download this show along with 4-12-2005 or 1-9-2002	PLAYitCACTUS	2016-07-07 14:16:08-04	2005-09-06 18:40:32-05
66219	12859	8	excellent	I dont think this wasnt the show Lotus filled in for STS9 for...this was the first night...(Lotus' best of 2 nights).  This show was absolutely smokin' and i was real excited when i heard Lotus was gonna be @ wakarusa.  Definitely a great performance!  CHECK THEM OUT!	KottkeKU	2016-07-07 14:16:08-04	2005-09-07 15:05:33-05
66220	12859	10	Exapnding Their and Our Horizons	This is a top notch Lotus show.  While the sound is a bit in ?, the energy and music is not.  Lotus steps up on one of the biggest shows they've had and hit!  They throw out some fresh material w/out a problem, drop some tight experimentations and whip up a totally ill crowd. This is what i would love to see more of out of Lotus.  4.5 for sound.	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:08-04	2005-09-24 10:18:58-05

66223	12861	10	This is a great example...	A great example of this bands potential, rise to better days.  Nice.  Energy is on, expermination is solid, doing what Lotus does best funkin' out the joint!  These cats are hitting their stride. Good recording sound. 4.5	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:09-04	2005-10-20 20:31:08-05

66228	12861	10	werd up	I was at this show it was awesome! It was flawless! I didn't know it was the best on the tour though, sweet!!  I heard it was originally for friday the 14th, but SCI was in town that day so they changed it! Thanks lotus!!	seekPEACE	2016-07-07 14:16:09-04	2005-11-30 19:09:23-05
66229	12861	10	nice	so i have been looking for different recordings of lotus i havnt heard in preparation for when i see these guys tomorrow night in minneapolis and this show is one of the BEST shows i have heard from these guys. Wax is always a hot song, nematode is pretty amped up too. SID rocks the house, and is flawless, they are so tight this night its not even funny, sometimes lotus can be a little bit sloppy in their improvisational jams but they are on tonight. Crisp recording too, nice work bean.	irie_cyclist	2016-07-07 14:16:09-04	2008-10-22 02:03:03-04
66230	12861	10	Rockin!!	Thanks for posting this- Quality! This is one of the first live Lotus shows I've heard..now just looking forward to the day I see them live. Sounds amazing!	robsy33	2016-07-07 14:16:09-04	2009-04-08 19:15:30-04

66234	12862	8	Superb Sound Quality	Very nice sound quality. I've never even heard of the group before last week and I'm excited to one day see them because of this show.\n\nContrary to what is listed, this show will not fit on two 80min audio CDs. The first disc is 83 min but can be whittled down to 81 (overburn) by removing the crowd track(s). The second disc is 88 min and even if removing the audio/banter, only makes it to 83. So you'll need to use 3.	GreenNuggs	2016-07-07 14:16:09-04	2006-01-17 09:35:25-05
66235	12862	8	L ' immeuble	the unknown track in the first set is titled\n\nL 'immeuble\n\ngood sounding show, a little too much coming off the high end for lotus, IMO needs more bass\n\n	kcmoeron09	2016-07-07 14:16:09-04	2009-03-18 09:45:00-04

66243	12863	10	Great Show, Moonset Encore?	Hey I know this is a stretch but I'm kind of OCD about my Lotus shows in my iTunes and I like to be super thorough. I read on another site's setlist for the same show that there was an Umbilical Moonset after the Sunrain encore? I'm not sure if this is accurate or not but I am looking for a file of that song if anyone could be so helpful. My email is branderson925@yahoo.com, feel free to shoot me a message if you can help me out. I have some cool shows to trade or just thanks and gratitude, haha.\n\nThis show is sick btw. Jack It Up during it's 18-month way too short life. Strong segues, jams range from chilled out to party-time hypeness. Sound quality is pretty crisp and clear. Thanks for sharing!\nPeace Love & Lotus,\nBrandon\n\nPS I'm almost positive Mikey teases "So Fresh, So Clean" during "IACTMN". Haha love it	branderson	2016-07-07 14:16:10-04	2013-08-26 16:06:16-04
66244	12863	10	Must Have	This is one of the best Lotus shows I have heard. Everyone should have it. Drunken Giraffe is awesome. So many great jams. 	bareblue28	2016-07-07 14:16:10-04	2014-01-19 19:44:23-05
66245	12864	10	not enough time	This was my first time seeing lotus live and i have to say that they played an amazing show for the short ass time they had to play... definitely worth the download, sound quality is great	ricky4207	2016-07-07 14:16:10-04	2005-08-12 09:01:35-05
66246	12864	6	Killer Bee Yall	This was a great show, great time, good download. It's worth it to hear Lotus. If only they played longer. Outs	Funkadelica	2016-07-07 14:16:10-04	2005-08-24 08:16:22-05
66247	12864	6	Ouch! Too bad about the mix	Lotus are their usual funky selves here -- but the sound quality is muddy and out of balance. (Synth in particular is far in the background.) Skip this one.	octothorp	2016-07-07 14:16:10-04	2005-11-29 11:01:20-05

66254	12867	10	Hell Yes!	Another fine example of the progress these cats are making.  It can be hard to find your groove in an opening set, but this is a nice attempt.  A nice lil' taste of Lotus groovin' the crowd! 4.5 on sound. 5 on music.	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:11-04	2005-10-22 12:09:25-05
66255	12867	10	Sick Show	Lotus rocks everytime I hear them. I don' think you can get much better. They are opening for STS 9 in this show, but I think it should have been the other way around after the way they played. LOTUS RULES!!!	Bubonic Tonic	2016-07-07 14:16:11-04	2006-05-02 15:16:48-04
66256	12868	8	Great Evening Set	Sounded like a perfect set for the eve.  Nice and chill, w/ bits of ummpphhh here and there.  Continued excellent experimentation and presentation.  Recording was solid.	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:11-04	2005-10-28 18:32:44-05

66260	12871	4	Ouch!	What a shame about the crowd noise (that's why the low rating) -- and not even appreciative crowd noise: just people yakking. But the music is indeed fantastic. Lotus is continuing to create fresh textures and sounds.	octothorp	2016-07-07 14:16:12-04	2005-04-28 21:23:33-05

66263	12872	10	GREAT SHOW	This was my first taste of Lotus and I am very impressed.  At first I thought that they sounded just like Sound Tribe Sector 9.  But I soon noticed that they have their own groove.  I had this disc in my truck for almost a week & I've listened to Umbilical Moonrise(track 7) maybe 20 times or more.  This is some very calming, peaceful music.	Don Litman	2016-07-07 14:16:12-04	2005-12-10 08:04:07-05

66265	12872	10	The Great LOTUS experience!	I am the taper of this show from the board thanks to Jesse whom blessed it.  Thanks man. From my analog Sony D-6 deck; just plugged in some l/r rca's per the sound guy and off it went.  My first show of them and the band could not have been cooler with photos and the like.  Thank you Boys!!!  Keep it rollin'....	cnokes	2016-07-07 14:16:12-04	2006-10-29 01:27:39-05

66271	12875	8	"these guys are good as fuck"	the banter before the show sums lotus up pretty well. Couple parts are a bit sloppy but they recover quickly, you can definitely tell how tired they were from the tour. Overall a really good show.

66275	12880	10	great show and great sound!!!	This show rocked my world, probably cuz it was my first, but I had listened to a few off of this site before.  The hometown venue and crowd played very well with the guys delivering a stand out performance.  You won't be able to stop moving or sit still listening to this show.  I came down for the night to visit my buddy (who lives almost right across the street from NSB) and let him see for himself what Lotus is all about, and he loved it.  We got wings and played some pool pre-show and then waited for the insanity.  Fun, Fun, Fun is all I can say :)	headyjammer	2016-07-07 14:16:15-04	2005-04-29 12:19:46-05

66277	12880	8	Solid Show - Great Recording	This show starts off hot.  Great experimentation and overall flow.  For me it seems to slow down toward the end - drop off in energy - maybe that's just me.  This recording Exhibits some of the bands stlye range too.	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:15-04	2005-08-14 15:27:08-05
66278	12880	8	intro to cell	Lotus is great.  Caught them in Raleigh.  I was randomly listening to this show and was wondering if anybody else caught the Crosseyed and Painless Phish tease during Intro to Cell? It really becomes aparent at around 8 mins.

66280	12882	10	Silky......	This is a very nice show. Shows off the Bass line well, balanced. The boys were nice and tight in this one. VERY weet Greet the Mind. I started download before I finished streaming the first song. It helps that this was my birthday show...damn....if only I was there.\n\nCheers.

66282	12882	10	Great Show	This was the 2nd time I saw these boys play live and once again, they completely blew me away. Nice setup w/ the video screens!	krupa809	2016-07-07 14:16:15-04	2005-07-22 11:42:36-05
66283	12882	10	Got my groove	Lotus sure do got my groove with this show -- and the sound quality is double-plus good. The other commenters are totally right about the clarity of the bass, but that's really just a good way of saying the whole mix is splendid.	octothorp	2016-07-07 14:16:15-04	2005-09-30 17:23:46-05
66284	12883	10	hoping for second set soon	I saw you guys setting up to record the show and was hoping you would get it up here and you did it and damn quick too! sounds great, listening now. great show and great sound quality. I probably had batteries too. oh well, hopefully someone will get second set up. Thanks for the quick upload and pics too!	lovedalivemusic	2016-07-07 14:16:15-04	2005-10-15 13:37:58-05

66287	12884	10	Awesome Night of Lotus>	this show is a five star performance, easily, and its one of my fondest concert experience in recent memory, loads of Lotus fans, intimate venue, friday night in Chicago, Lotus in the house, two full sets, all made for a memorable evening of music, thanks to Bean for uploading this recording, and thanks to Lotus for the music	Grider	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2005-12-18 13:08:49-05
66288	12885	10	THANK YOU!!!!!!!	THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for posting this show! My friends and I were so jacked that Lotus came to Bloomington, went, and they were on point. Totally pimp show, especially when they busted into Crosseyed and Painless for a short jam, we lost it. Lotus, please come back to B-town anytime, we love you.

66291	12885	10	"Make it funky! Uh-oh, that's funky!"	I've seen Lotus just once in Cincinati at the Viper room.  It was simply amazing, I was drenched with sweat when I left, and I don't think I've heard a bad performance by these guys.  To me, they seem to the best emerging band on the scene.  They're precise and full of energy and fun, and this show would be a great way to be introduced to them. \nAs some dude in the crowd demonstrates with that brillant quote, they never let any request for quality sounds go un-heard.  \n  	CreationMyth	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2006-11-07 03:53:42-05
66292	12886	6	not good sound.	The bass sounds odd, and the mix is not right. ITs not terrible, and the playing is on. These guys really benefit from soundboards, as you don't get the harmonic vibe here as clearly.	tragnast	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2005-08-12 00:35:06-05
66293	12886	6	Setlist	1. Intro\n2. Suitcases and Sandwiches\n3+4. Did Fatt\n4. Flower Sermon\n1. Mikesnack\n2. Sunrain, Greet the Mind\n3. Spiritualize\n4. Outro	Derreck	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2005-09-09 13:47:20-05
66294	12886	6	What is it about these guys?	They are talented and very groovy- but sometimes even in a sweet show like this you wonder if they can't take it to another level. Sometimes i listen to them and it feels like they are butting their heads against a wall trying to let out a heart-felt sound.  As a jam band there is only some much room in the heap and while the scene has changed drastically in the past yr. one things remains - music that is heart and soul wins fans.  Come on Lotus - let the FUNk out!  (REVISION - i stand by my assesment above, but after listening to the next nights show and now seeing these guys again and listening to more shows on-line, it is very obvious that they are progressing in a most amazing way - And i luve it!) Give it a 3, very solid show - recording seems a bit up and down.	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2005-10-31 21:24:19-05
66295	12887	8	^_^	cool band with a cool name and a cool sound\n\nnice "fast dancing" music\n\nand BTW, you can get a .shn plug-in for winamp at etree.org (if you dont use winamp, i suggest you do:P it can be found at download.com)	Sage of Eris	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2006-01-20 10:35:20-05
66296	12887	10	awesome show	i saw these guys both nights at the jazz cafe, excellent shows but the NYE show was particularly good.  \ni saw these mics clamped up to the beams, im really glad that this show got posted! definately worth the dowload.  \nthe set is a 5.the recording has some yelling but thats just how it was that night -tons of energy-\ngo see lotus	entheogen	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2006-01-22 00:25:10-05

66299	12887	10	sickness	was here this night, biscuits in NY night before so i wasnt expecting to be really blown away (considering the Biscuits 12-30-05 was completely insane shit) but Lotus managed to keep me mesmerized all throughout. the Lucid Awakening > Soma > Lucid Awakening was some intense shit, Lotus never dissapoint and this show is no exception. Get this and see what Lotus is all about in this new year	damit_im_lohocla	2016-07-07 14:16:16-04	2006-06-04 15:27:05-04

66311	12892	8	milestones	Amazing night, it was cold outside but nice and toasty on the dancefloor! I dont think ive ever been so sore from dancing before however it was more like continuous jumping out of pure excitement than dancing. Most definately worth the download and the sound is great. Thanks goes out to the taper, I talked to you during set break but cant recall your name.	BenMech	2016-07-07 14:16:18-04	2005-12-09 14:47:18-05
66312	12892	10	Amazing	I drove 7 hours from VT foer this show and it was well worth it.  Lotus put on an incredible show filled with crazy huge energy and a great flow.\n*Steve did the "Shark Attack" during Whip It	SharkAttack	2016-07-07 14:16:18-04	2005-12-12 14:13:30-05

66317	12894	8	Bass	Great show, just slightly disappointed that you have to strain to hear Chuck and Jesse.  Looking forward to Chris's onstage source for comparison.  Thanks for sharing it - it's difficult to get a perfect mix out of the board so this is by no means Duff's err, it's just a room mix rather than a recording mix.	staylorrr	2016-07-07 14:16:19-04	2005-10-29 10:11:23-05
66318	12894	10	great	my first live lotus show and i was very impressed. the whole place was a dance party and it looked like everyone was having a good time gettin down. cant wait to catch them again.	muldi	2016-07-07 14:16:19-04	2005-11-01 16:09:20-05
66319	12894	8	Groovy	Lotus does not disappoint, once again. The sound quality is not perfect (though very good). I was lucky enough to be at this show, so my thanks go to the good people who recorded it.	octothorp	2016-07-07 14:16:19-04	2005-11-07 14:59:18-05

66324	12896	10	Set II !!!	the second set of this show is the best single Lotus set I have ever heard, the unrelenting jams, the segues between songs without interruption, the song selection, and the energy of the crowd make this a phenomenal set of live music, and this is the only recording of this show that exists, no one patched from the board (though I tried but could not get a signal) and I was the only taper, five star performance, probabably a four star recording at best, enjoyable nonetheless, thanks Lotus	Grider	2016-07-07 14:16:19-04	2006-06-12 20:39:36-04
66325	12896	10	Sid > epic Jam	This show is worth a download for the Sid into such a great jam. Everyone should hear The Shimmer > IACTMN > Shimmer Its heaven	bareblue28	2016-07-07 14:16:19-04	2014-01-19 19:57:44-05
66326	12897	8	Birthday Show!	Lotus rocked it hard for this long one setter.  This band only continues to improve and experiment night in and night out. Not only did they wish me happy bday but they played my request for plant your root down!  Such a great set of guys.  Be sure to check out Plant Your Root Down, and Spirtualize both are tight versions.  Thanx to Phunky Zen for getting this up so fast.  A great 2005 download for any lotus fans.

66332	12900	10	me agian	This show kicked ass.  Even the opening band Jazzam was pretty tight.  Cannot wait to see Lotus again.  Was standing dead center, front row untill...\n\n...stupid security snatched my buddy and I for drinkin PBRs. You can smoke weed freely there but kids using a LEGAL drug get thrown out.  Makes little sense. Oh well, missed last 3 or 4 songs but the rest was a blast.  Can't wait to see DizzyIzzy's video of this.	bobweirdork	2016-07-07 14:16:21-04	2007-01-18 02:49:55-05
66333	12900	8	rager but...	i think its worthy to note that the band stayed awake from the night before and played on another bands instruments...otherwise it was a rager Mr. Smalls is intense, peace	deadhd4ever	2016-07-07 14:16:21-04	2007-01-22 01:17:31-05
66334	12900	8	Solid Solid Solid	This is a tight show all the way through.. Greet the Mind, Suitcases and Sandwiches are exceptional, and I get a laugh out of these guys doing The Final Countdown.    They really seem to be coming into their own style, with a little laid-back funk thrown into the dance machine.	kowasaki23	2016-07-07 14:16:21-04	2007-01-22 22:43:03-05

66338	12901	10	sickness	this whole show is sick, check out the Sunrain>Did Fatt>Sunrain combo, its completely over the top, and the show features long extended jams throughout the show, much more edgy and often psychedelic style than Lotus normally displays, even the encore is the heat, thanks to Lotus for another amazing show, and thanks to Shawn for posting this recording, on a side note the Schoeps mk4v recording source for this show will be added to archive.org soon too, and it should sound a little better than my recording, so check back soon for a download of that source for this excellent Lotus show	Grider	2016-07-07 14:16:22-04	2006-07-27 22:00:34-04
66339	12901	10	Great show	This is one of the better performances I've heard from these guys.  Really, really solid show.  The great thing is the recording is equal to show's high quality.

66340	12901	8	Solid	Well this was not the best show of the year, but it was strong.  Seemed like there was so tech issue or missed connections from the band.  The Sunrain>Did Fatt>Sunrain was nice and spacey!  Great recording.  Thanks!  3.5	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:22-04	2006-08-13 02:04:01-04

66357	12908	10	Lotus first sold out show	What an experience.  I arrived with my son and 5 of his high school friends.  Since I was over 21 (closer to sixty), they let us in.  Actually, we were told that the show was sold out and we talked to the manager who I had happened to call earlier in the day and reminded him of that phone call and he let us in. Before the show began one of the members of Lotus (don't remember which on) told us that this is their first sold out show and what a magical evening it turned out to be.  During their intermission, I asked if it I needed a stamp to get back in and the doorman laughed because I was about 35-40 years older than everyone else and he told me that he would remember me.  I walked outside and loved the smell.  Everyone outside was indulging.  Since this show, I have seen Lotus at least 20 times (who is counting) from a very small venue (small boat around NYC harbor that held maybe 75 people) to a huge concert hall in Chicago   (over 2,000 people). I wish I was 40 years younger so I could become a groupie and just follow them around.  If you ever meet anyone who loves jam bands (lounge music), let them know it is a treat to see these guys.\n\nWarmest regards,\n    - Stanley from Boston\n	Stanley from Boston	2016-07-07 14:16:24-04	2011-12-15 23:41:13-05
66358	12910	8	Thanks!	Thanks for taping and uploading this show. I hope you enjoyed it and will tape Lotus whenever they're back in town. \n\nFor the record, I think Dana's copy has a little less crowd chatter. Would you agree?	The Lung	2016-07-07 14:16:25-04	2006-10-21 20:19:31-04
66359	12910	8	Lotus 2006-10-05	Yes, I would agree that Dana's copy does indeed have less chatter.  This is due to the fact that he was running ck63 hypercardiod caps.  My source is just cardiod.  \n\nHope you enjoy it!	jbanyai97	2016-07-07 14:16:25-04	2006-10-21 23:21:40-04
66360	12911	10	most excellent>	I always love to see lost recordings like this one (recorded but not circulated for whatever reason) tracked down, shared by the taper, and put into circulation at long last, thanks to Lotus and to all of those involved in this project, look for the recent Telluride 2006 recording, also recorded but not yet circulated, here soon as well, bless the tapers!

66363	12912	10	matrix	wow, thanks jdub ;D this matrix might sound weirder because i did it track by track, i dunno if weirder was the right word, but some high-hat and shit like that was mastered a bit different this time around, rather than doing the matrix set by set(which is ALOT easier)\n\nEnjoy!

66365	12912	10	Great sound	The matrix sounds awesome.  It does seem like some of the tracks sound a little differant than others though. The Did Fatt is the highlight of the first set in my mind. The spiritualize sounded a little looser than normal.  I haven't got a chance to listen to the second set through headphones yet, which is what I've been doing with all the shows lately on the first listen.\nThanks for all the effort of getting this up. In my fantasy world all shows should sound this clear. It seems like most of the recent shows have all been exceptionaly clear.	jdub42	2016-07-07 14:16:25-04	2006-03-11 20:30:14-05
66366	12912	10	nice find	If you like Lotus and you like great sounding archive.org recordings, then this one will take a big chunk of the cake. It captures a very real "live" sound, minus the annoying crowd banter, but still maintaining nice crowd reaction.  The show is high energy and captures a seemingly great evening. The quality in  whole is a rare find in my eyes.  Enjoy.\nP.S. Lotus...hit up Portland ,OR again....and soon.	ub_illin	2016-07-07 14:16:25-04	2006-04-09 03:54:14-04

In my opinion, this is the best Lotus show thus far, but I sincerely believe that much better shows are on the way.  Now, with that said, I plan on preparing myself for the groove that is to come.

66397	12925	10	Good times	Lotus was sick to see in the wee hours of the morning in Kansas. If someone puts up their show from the following day, I would highly recommend that one, but this one is good, too. Thanks.	CollyR	2016-07-07 14:16:31-04	2006-06-14 04:42:35-04
66398	12925	8	Revival Tent	The Lotus set that the previous poster is talking about (the one early saturday morning or late friday night) is defintiely a magical set.  I have never heard lotus do anything that cool.  So if ANYONE has that set PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE post it up.  But this is still a great set as well in its own right.  4 stars (i rarely give 5) for this set.  Thanks to EVERYONE who tapes and shares these shows and sticks em up here for everyone to listen to.

66400	12925	10	Thank You Sam!	Thank you very much for taping this set and getting the recording up on archive so quickly! This is an awesome recording and a great representation of what Lotus does during their late-night Wakarusa sets. This was my favorite set of the weekend and just barely edged out Lotus' late-night Wakarusa throwdown from last year, imo.	Sneaksox	2016-07-07 14:16:31-04	2006-06-15 21:28:37-04
66401	12925	10	WOW	This was a sick set for sure...just incredible...could NOT peel myself away for anything else!

It's also cool to hear the whole nights music; DJ Harry and all. Check out the First Tube remix. It whips the crowd. Heard this in Cincy as well. Short show, amazing versions of all!\n\n~HARPER~	HARP	2016-07-07 14:16:32-04	2006-05-09 06:26:05-04

The mix is about 80% in favor of the board feed.\n\nBlue Giant had a tape wrinkle that could not be fixed, and I actually edited out about a bar of music, although I challenge anyone to find it.\n\nOne Last Hurrah has a fade out because my tape ended.  Really sucks because that song was the highlight of the show for me (brian).\n \nSETLIST:\n\nWooly Mammoth\n\nArupa > Slow Cookin'\n\nKesey Seed\n\nBlue Giant\n\nOne Last Hurrah\n\n \n\nTurquoise\n\nBall of Energy > Juggernaut\n\nCirrus\n\nLivingston Storm\n\nPapercut > Nematode\n\nE: Intro to a Cell\n\n*********************************************\n\nVIDEO...\n\nhttp://music.onsight-media.com/lotus/	dvxbrian	2016-07-07 14:16:32-04	2007-01-20 00:44:11-05

66413	12931	8	Great show, new songs	Hadn't heard these songs yet from lotus till i got to the show.  blew me away.  One Last Hurrah is amazing.  great vibes, great show.	swerveburd	2016-07-07 14:16:32-04	2007-05-25 00:30:50-04
66414	12933	8	Great!	Very energetic show.... Nice pace and execution.  This particular recording is actually quite good!!  It's not muddy, or too much bass, but in fact well balanced and cranks pretty good!   	rustyD	2016-07-07 14:16:33-04	2006-12-06 02:16:34-05
66415	12934	10	haven't heard it yet but....	I have been doing sound for a while. I actually mixed at this show. When I started getting into promotions this was the first band I wanted to see make it Syracuse! I haven't heard this show since that night but I am downloading it now. I am glad I was able to help make this happen!	buddhacasper	2016-07-07 14:16:34-04	2007-01-16 20:24:22-05
66416	12935	10	YESSS!!!	alright sweet!  This was my favorite show of the entire festival.  Lotus rocked out hardcore for this one.  I coulda swore they played a few more encores though.  Was jump off the last song they played?  Hmm...i cant remember lol.  I hope this is the whole set...Nevertheless, still an easy 5 stars for show, 4 stars for sound.  Im gonna go ahead and give it a 5 just because they were so hot.  This is definitely worth the download!	KottkeKU	2016-07-07 14:16:34-04	2006-06-15 05:22:44-04

66419	12935	10	Rockin'	Is anybody else totally psyched about the Crazy Train (Ozzy Osbourne) tease at the end of Jump Off?  I have seen Lotus a lot and have never seen them cover any tunes or tease anything but their own songs, so that was exciting for me.\n\nThe recording sounds great, lots of definition, not much crowd noise for an AUD.  I'm really enjoying it.  Thank you.	fUNKYbret	2016-07-07 14:16:34-04	2006-06-25 15:51:53-04
66420	12935	10	Liquid Flow	This show was amazing.  I traveled a long wayt to Wakarusa to primarily see Lotus.  Kinda bumbed they didn't play earlier in the day.  I wouldn't have missed it no matter what the time.  It was out of this world.  Put me in another world.  Very crisp and filtered sound.  One of my favorite shows also.  Follow this band.  They've just gotten started.  Peace!!!	Bdog33F	2016-07-07 14:16:34-04	2006-06-27 01:43:23-04

This show was absolutely mind blowing, each song exponentially better than the one before it, culminating with the 26 minute Moonrise > Lucid > Moonrise > Lucid. These guys are unstoppable, and I guarentee you that you will not find a more dancin' groovin' funkin' concert for $5 anywhere.

66432	12941	10	YEAH!!!	Finally i have been awaiting this. What a great night we all had.the opening band Psylab was awesome, ive seen those guys a few times but they dont compair to Lotus. This show was OFF THE HOOK! i feel every time i see them they get better and better. At first i wasent really a fan of there newer stuff but this show proves that Lotus is strong and kickin'Spritulize was Unreal. The encore Lucid Awakening was phenomenal and i am now a fan of one of the new songs Torquoise. If your a Lotus fan i highly suggest you DL this show	weekapa	2016-07-07 14:16:36-04	2006-12-07 01:10:03-05
66433	12941	8	Very nice!	Thanks for putting up this stellar performance from Lotus!  Would have rated five stars from me if the recording level were higher.

66435	12941	10	great recording and show	What a fun show this was. I always love Lotus at the Paradise. This show was no exception. Love the L'immeuble opener and the absolutely balls to the walls version of P/E Counterpoint (now known as Through the Mirror). Intro to a Cell is always a favorite of mine and this one brings the d'n'b rage that we all know and love. \n\nSpiritualize was the fucking heat! Absolutely the best version of this song I've ever heard, and thats a claim. Turqoise is a funky new song that I am really into, same with At Last Glance (which would make the dopest hip hop beat ever). One Last Hurrah and Wax absolutely destroy the end of this show, they tear these to pieces. Get this show.	phillycheeseblunt	2016-07-07 14:16:36-04	2007-05-30 19:54:51-04

66437	12944	10	Download this!	This is a deep show.  It's starts crackin' from the first note and goes along perfectly 'til the encore.  Set list is constructed just right - shows another step of maturity in this young band.  Highlights include hearing Chuck's voice, keys on the encore, Steve's subtle work on SIB and Mike axing it up on Slow Cookin'!  Sound is a little echoed, but the energy and flava of this show is strong!  \nHttp://FlowFeel.com	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:40-04	2006-02-26 16:15:14-05

66446	12945	10	More Bass!	Lotus is a band that needs to have higher bass levels than other bands.  On a lot of recording the bass ets lost, and with Lotus, that would be shame.\n\n3 cheers for the tapers!	therivler1	2016-07-07 14:16:40-04	2007-10-04 17:35:37-04

It's one of my favorite Lotus recordings I've ever done :) Check out my Summerdance 2014 Lotus recordings too. Both nights were frickin AMAZING IMO! And truly relit my spirit for Lotus again :)\n\nAnd my 2.17.2006 Matrix the show before this one is definitely one for the ages, and probably the best Matrix on archive.org for Lotus.

66452	12946	6	cool band!	I had herad the name of the band tons of times but never their music. Gave this show a stream because it was a 'staff pick' and it really sounds great! The quality is amazing. The band has no vocals but has an interesting 'blip-beep' electronic instrument with a live drummer and synth? it's catchy and definately 'jammy' a little bit. d2t02 was fun. almost borders on 'club' / 'dance' music a little... with enough electronica for fun. A cool band, if they come to my town and it's not too $$ i'd go. plus they are pro-taping, which is always cool!	Tyler	2016-07-07 14:16:40-04	2006-07-01 20:03:30-04
66453	12946	10	I must say	This show takes you to a peak right from the start. Then you go through cycles of euphoria and intense rhythmic funk. Very smooth, futuristic, funky, and holistic...It likes driving down the road and smelling a skunk...you know its da funk...LOTUS!!!	Check1234567	2016-07-07 14:16:40-04	2008-10-01 07:45:08-04

66455	12947	10	A delicious breakfast of Lotus	I personally couldn't think of any other thing that I would rather wake up to. An excellent set from Lotus even though the time slot wasn't ideal.

66467	12955	8	rockin'	An awesome show. Sweeeet ass palindrome action in the first set, incredible to witness. Very experimental in sections. Moonset sounds like an industrial factory exploded into musical form, definately raging. Great funked out Bubonic to kick off the second set. A very psychedelic jam came out of Nematode. For an encore, my first live Hammerstrike, a very impressive introduction to the song. Very solid recording, big thanks to Jesse for taping this show.	phillycheeseblunt	2016-07-07 14:16:43-04	2007-05-16 00:55:22-04

66470	12956	8	Solid	Not the explosive Lotus that we have been hearing alot of in the past year - more chill, experimental.  If you are looking for action-packed-energy this show is not that - if you want to see the talent this band has take a closer listen to the details of this show!

66473	12957	10	Maybe we have Groove	Yep.  1st set is nearly perfect in design and 2nd set is close, execution of 2nd set is tight.  Expired Slang is delicious. 	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:45-04	2006-12-30 02:12:00-05
66474	12958	10	Great show!	I've been listening to lotus for about a year, thinking that their music would make for a lame concert, but I'm happy that I was wrong! an awesome show, the stone church is a chill place too.\nRecordings just can't do bands justice!\nJam on	zja1	2016-07-07 14:16:45-04	2006-01-28 10:42:43-05
66475	12958	10	Lotus	Lotus is never a lame show.  They get better and better every time I see them and this show was no exception.  Definiately the best Lotus show I've seen and quite possibly the best concert I've seen period.  Check out Lotus and download this show.  Great quality recording too, thanks.	SharkAttack	2016-07-07 14:16:45-04	2006-02-02 07:22:39-05
66476	12958	10	ummmm...right	Yeah I don't even know where to start with this show. Sooo much energy and good vibes going around that joint. Gotta give it up for the Stone Church getting all of our friends in eventually. My first Lotus show, wow. I can't believe its taken me this long to see these guys. Fucking sick sick bells solo on Flower Sermon. Yum. Can't wait for my next show.	phillycheeseblunt	2016-07-07 14:16:45-04	2006-02-02 18:40:49-05
66477	12958	8	Nice	Yea i love when Lotus busts out the bells or marimbas or whatever they are.  I like those too man :)  This is definitely a good show, excellent sound all around.  Great set.  Thx!!!	KottkeKU	2016-07-07 14:16:45-04	2006-02-06 14:45:51-05

66480	12958	8	penis and vagina	he yells out penis and vagina. Both are good and in so way should be silenced. I give this 4 stars for penis and vagina. This shows cool and junk but not incredible by any means.	dickdeoreo	2016-07-07 14:16:45-04	2010-02-20 21:07:50-05
66481	12958	8	flower sermon > shimmer and out	This show is definitely worth the download.  The sound quality is almost a 5/5, and the sermon > shimmer is beautiful and i can't help but dance to it.  The encore is also a treat, very funky.  Download it!	pedalmonster	2016-07-07 14:16:45-04	2010-08-21 15:44:31-04

66484	12959	10	oh yeah	Lotus is beginning to become one of the most creative bands on the scene. I dont know what the Lung was thinking but this show is definately one of the best on the run. One of the better shows of the whole winter season. Recording is also amazing. \nDOWNLOAD THIS SHOW	GolgiApparatus	2016-07-07 14:16:46-04	2006-03-14 20:51:39-05

66485	12959	2	REMOVE THIS SHOW	This show should be removed from circulation for two reasons: \n1) The second set is tracked at over 90 minutes long. To fit the show on 2 discs, you need to put the encore (d2t6) on disc 1 and shorten d2t5 by about 30 seconds. \n2) The clipping (overloading) is awful in many places, and makes this show basically unlistenable. I don't know what GolgiApparatus is thinking. While we all apreciate the efforts that went into taping this show and getting it uploaded to the Archive, this recording is far from amazing - at times, it's just very, very bad.	The Lung	2016-07-07 14:16:46-04	2006-03-16 08:17:36-05
66486	12959	6	Good for now...	Respect to Ben for getting the board feed and doing the work to circulate the show.\n\nIt may not be the best recording, but so far it is the only one.\n\nThere is a multi-track recording of this in the hands of the band, so we will have to wait and see if the goods ever surface.	dvxbrian	2016-07-07 14:16:46-04	2006-03-18 17:50:04-05
66487	12959	10	dance party	Very nasty show.  They definitely fed off the fact that the place was packed that night...I agree one of the better shows too bad it was in a lame ass wannabe town (HAHA)and not in a true party town like FOCO.  I don't recall a point where I stopped dancing...so was a great show!	cheesemasterfunk	2016-07-07 14:16:46-04	2006-03-24 08:45:05-05
66488	12959	2	stereo channels switched	the left and right channels are switched on this recording for some reason - most people won't care, but if you picture the band the guitar is on the right and its coming from the left speaker	spiraling line of light	2016-07-07 14:16:46-04	2006-09-13 20:14:57-04

66500	12966	10	Wow	This show is unbelievable. The Intro/Shimmer/Intro/Shimmer/Intro/Shimmer is just silly. Lotus at their finest. Wow. Not to mention the slaying that is WAX. Mmmmm. Unbelievable recording too, nice warm board.	phillycheeseblunt	2016-07-07 14:16:49-04	2007-01-30 21:09:22-05
66501	12966	10	Boss...very Boss	This is a strong show - the 2nd set is off the table. Very curious to see where the band goes with the set directions on this tour.  Some very sudden, smooth segues early on.  4.5 stars.	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:16:49-04	2007-02-02 05:01:44-05

66503	12966	10	Solid	Thanks to Chris K for the great pull and Lotus for another great show.  The PYR > Flower Sermon, Hammerstike is evil.  Nematod and Wax are on fire and the intro > shimmer....  works very well.  Great way to start off the tour!	JNap	2016-07-07 14:16:49-04	2007-02-03 05:42:08-05
66504	12966	8	Bass?	Did anyone else notice the lack of bass guitar, especially in the second set?  I grabbed the VBR files, so maybe that's it, or maybe I just need to listen again, and more carefully.  The bass is just so integral to this band, and there were times in the second set that sounded a little off balance due to a lack of that bass foundation.  Anyone else experience this?  The show itself-- awesome!  In my mind, the show doesn't really take off until Root>Sermon, but then it never looks back.  And the space laid out at the end of Ball of Energy suits my fancy.	H.B.

66505	12966	10	Lotus	Good ass set.  Great recording, and recommend to download instantly.  The first song of the show sounds like it would be in a Super Nintendo video game.	jjbrack	2016-07-07 14:16:49-04	2009-04-21 20:11:56-04
66506	12966	10	Sick Show	Overall this was a badass show. I do have to agree with a previous comment that the second set is definetly quieter for some reason, but you can just turn up the volume.	funkin a	2016-07-07 14:16:49-04	2010-05-17 20:24:42-04

66514	12969	10	Best of the 3 sources.........	IMO this is BY FAR the best of the 3 Lotus sources for this set! Way to go Team 48x>722 :D Much fuller and in your face sound than the other 2, which sound distant IMO......\n\nNice job as usual TJ!	Bean420	2016-07-07 14:16:50-04	2007-12-01 20:10:06-05
66515	12970	10	Oh Yeah	Lotus only had a 45 minute set but again it was absolutely great. Flower Sermon to close rocked and the crowd was loving it.  Just like Penn's Landing..short, but sweet and full of energy. This was definitely a highlight of the weekend for me. I would highly suggest this DL. In fact get every damn set from this festival cause it all kicked ass.  Save maybe Les Claypool...cant deny the skill but his weird vibe takes my trip the wrong direction.\n\n5 Stars.\n\nMan do I wish SOJA was taper friendly..about the only thing missing on archive at this point.

I definitely stood up during this set!\nIt was my 1st time seeing them live after hearing lots of dowloads of theirs........they certainly lived up to the expectations I had developed.

66525	12972	10	red suits	good show. breakdancing video was funny as shit. Wax and Alkaline encore were good ways to end the show.	Gribblecake	2016-07-07 14:16:54-04	2007-11-28 01:37:46-05
66526	12972	10	Its good to have Lotus back home.	This show was awesome, the venue was sweet, sound qualtiy was fantastic, I was smashed, and Lotus was spreading the vibes. I have been seeing Lotus since 2002, I first saw them in the fall of "02" at Murray's Inn in Wilkes-Barre. From then until now the progress, innovation, and experimentation that Lotus has been doing for the last couple years has improved their individual and collective performances to the highest quality. Amazing, keep up the good work Lotus.	Jagerrulez	2016-07-07 14:16:54-04	2007-11-29 20:20:53-05

66532	12975	10	Thanks for Sharing	JAson!  Thanks for sharing this!  Just downloaded your copy, listening now and recalling the great second set this show had.	Brad Leblanc	2016-07-07 14:16:55-04	2011-12-05 14:40:32-05
66533	12976	10	lotus makes me wet	pretty good recording. i really like the jams inbetween songs. great version on alkaline.  papercut is one of my favorties.  real funky did fatt too   two tumbs up for this show, i will be posting video footage of it eventually	dizzy izzy	2016-07-07 14:16:55-04	2007-12-06 03:35:00-05
66534	12976	8	great	really nice show. did fatt > moonset is really good. the nematode gets fucking dirty. ending with intro to a cell was great.	daver00lzd00d	2016-07-07 14:16:55-04	2013-08-11 08:21:14-04
66535	12980	8	Oh Heck Yes	Very smokin' show - the band is really putting out some heat in their 2nd sets these days - NICE!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:16:56-04	2007-03-10 23:36:38-05
66536	12980	10	outstanding recording	This show absolutely kills, especially the second set. I really dig the segue from Mike's Snack->Travel, a combo I never thought I'd see together but they came together so smoothly. The Livingston is ungodly, they really took that song to another level. Sure enough this was just a taste of what was to come of the 2nd set. Greet the Mind->Did Fatt->Sunrain->Moonset->Sunrain. This was mind-numbing. I cannot even begin to explain the epicness of this massive sandwhich. You need to hear it for yourself. This is Lotus at their finest. This is by far one of the best recordings of shows that I have attended, sounds so warm and crisp. Thanks for taping and the super quick turnaround, its greatly appreciated by many.	phillycheeseblunt	2016-07-07 14:16:56-04	2007-03-11 20:09:57-04
66537	12980	10	Lotus = THE SHIT	Ok Ok people so you're debating, fuckin A., Lotus is the shit. Period. GO FUCKIN SEE THEM!!! If you like to boogie, your prayers are answered. I couldn't imagine having a bad time at one of their shows. They just played here in Wisco, fuckin rippin, and by the way, download this show it's sick. Rock on Lotus, fuckin A! Thanks.	Kovski13	2016-07-07 14:16:56-04	2007-04-27 05:03:44-04
66538	12980	10	2nd set	The second set of this show is "soooo good".  Particularly the GTM > Did Fatt > Sunrain > Moonset > Sunrain.  \nGTM has an insane building crescendo and then flawlessly drops into a funky talking heads style groove.  Did Fatt "goes there" with some crazy building and releasing too.  The last Sunrain is so beautiful it transcends description and is the perfect ending to a crucial song combination.  \nI love how Lotus works so well together create a collective sound, and there is never any sense of one member showing a big ego.  THIS is what it's about.  Get into it.	phunkSteve	2016-07-07 14:16:56-04	2007-06-01 14:31:58-04
66539	12980	10	Lotus needs the respect they deserve	Lotus is the only band that continues to impress me by taking it further and further show after show.  Why arent these guys headling all the big festivals..I would love to see them throw down some super 4-6 hour sets sometime.\n\nKeep up the good work boys!	StoneySageBoy	2016-07-07 14:16:56-04	2007-08-01 04:12:43-04
66540	12981	6	One set wonder	Decent 1 setter.  Sound is a bit hushed - maybe the way the building is designed.  Great Slow Cookin' jam!!  	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:16:57-04	2007-03-04 05:51:31-05
66541	12982	10	You should download this	I saw this concert live and was one of the best shows ive ever seen.  It has a good mix of brand new stuff and a few tracks from their older albums too.  The newest song, "Death of Bees" i personally suggested should be called "Cosmic Waves" (im not sure if you can hear me shout in the recording) but its amazing either way.\n\n!LOTUS!  HELL YEAH!	vexedsalmon	2016-07-07 14:16:57-04	2007-06-17 22:04:27-04
66545	12988	8	Deserve a better slot	What a way to start of this fest - with a set like this kicking it off some people probably were toast by 8 pm.  A great run of songs - and a funny joke by Luke!  Jump Off is very good - even w/ an overload of keys.	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-03-22 05:38:55-04
66546	12988	10	Great!	Wasnt there just ramdomly dowloaded the show.  Glad i did , rocked out canit wait to see them through the chicago,madison milwauke run!  Be Easy! ONE LAST HURRAH-SICK!	upthecanyon	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-04-06 18:30:08-04
66547	12988	10	sweet small set	great set they played at this fun festival.These guys get better and better everytime i see them.	Birchola	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-04-06 19:37:22-04
66548	12988	10	Totally orgasmix!!!	Great set !\nSunrain>Around the World>Sunrain has a marvellous end.\ngreat great great show !	aguion	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-04-18 23:42:45-04
66549	12989	10	Good as it gets	I think this show defines and sums up their entire fall run. It just keeps getting better and better to places where you didnt think Lotus could bring it...Recording besides the seconds of Jug missed is absolutely right on. The energy was incredible and both the band and crowd came ready to party. \n\nCheck out YouTube.com to check out clips of songs from the show. Guys looked outrageous with their costumes. Lotus is really making their presence felt on many levels.\n\nA must DL 100% the absolute truth.	PastPresents	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-11-08 06:23:19-05
66550	12989	8	nice	lotus continues to sound great.	Flying Spaghetti Monster	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-11-27 17:06:43-05
66551	12989	8	solid lotus	nothing too extraordinary here, just a super solid show by lotus. i recommend it.	john.page10	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2009-11-11 20:45:17-05
66552	12989	8	Discovery :)	Nice to find old good shows you've overlooked. Very unique setlist even for this time period. Maybe b/c its Halloween. Really digging into some extra deep improv. Also can tell the band is having alot of fun from the banter. also Bellweater is actually Age of Inexperience.	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2010-07-02 06:08:39-04
66553	12990	10	the chronic	this shit is off the wall, lotus has gotten so good in the past year it blows my mind, this definately rivals the 2-17-06 show, sick recording as well	kidwithair34	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-11-28 00:38:19-05
66554	12990	10	Sound is incredible	I gave this a 5 start rating because the quality of the recording is AMAZING!  The performance is great too with Did Fatt being the highlight for me.\n\nBut out of this and the next night, id get the next night.	bisco2	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2007-11-28 22:21:26-05
66555	12990	10	Zelda theme!	Holy sh1t!  Zelda theme brings me back...The Did Fatt > Greet the Mind sequence is complete fire. Cant wait for winter tour 2007!	chapelphish	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2008-01-23 00:03:11-05
66556	12990	10	sound quality	An emphatic tip of the cap to all parties responsible for this recording.  I've personally never heard a finer live recording in terms of sound quality.\n\nAnd thank you Lotus, for bringing that vibrant funk every time.	H.B. Woodrose	2016-07-07 14:16:59-04	2008-04-15 21:35:02-04
66557	12992	8	Chilly	Cold in Maddy-Town, the music was chill. Love the way the band moved from ultra-hype Sat. in Chicago to easy-grooves in Mad-Milwk.  This is a very solid, flowin. Luv Kalea. No tapers in Chi-city! -Block Rockin' Beats for ours ears only :)	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:00-04	2007-04-13 02:48:47-04
66558	12992	10	Saw Chicago show, danced my ass off	Yeah I didn't catch this show but I was at the Chicago show and got to say it was jumping (literally) the whole way through. Really energetic crowd with good vibes (not an energetic crowd with bad vibes, and I've seen em'). It was my first time seeing Lotus and they definately kicked ass. Definately worth seeing.\n\nBack with another one of those block rockin' beats.	wspsaves	2016-07-07 14:17:00-04	2007-04-15 04:51:01-04
66559	12992	8	Rock on	Not the best quality tape, but definitely brings the pain. Do these guys ever play a bad show? GO SEE LOTUS! Move that ass........	Kovski13	2016-07-07 14:17:00-04	2007-04-27 05:07:09-04
66560	12992	8	wow	I found out about this show just hours before it started and burned up 3 hours of highway just to see it on easter sunday. it was well worth the trip! marisol and sunrain were the highlights of the night for me, and just my luck they didn't get recorded. gotta knock down the rating just for that, but the rest of the show is still pretty sick.	Hendo1024	2016-07-07 14:17:00-04	2007-05-09 04:08:38-04
66561	12992	4	next night was betterrrrr....	thought most of this show was a little off, couldn't get over the backtracks..the next night at the saloon was kicking with most of particle...	bombsiniraq	2016-07-07 14:17:00-04	2007-05-21 00:31:03-04
66562	12994	8	bass!	Jesse's bass tones sound great - probably because its right off his rig instead of the PA.  I've steered away from doing onstage or stage-lip recordings of Lotus for a few years now due to the band playing larger venues and all the keys/samples that sometimes get lost up front.  This recording is quite balanced and has a HUGE soundstage.  The energetic crowd near the mic is only a minor distraction.  Shame I'm missing their Philly gigs in Nov., sounds like the band is still on fire.  Thanks for the tunes, Brian!	Craig T	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2007-10-31 23:06:28-04
66563	12994	6	Damn Kids	The bass mix does sound pretty good, although some of the other sound seems quiet at times.  I attended this show and have to say Park West is the shit besides the over aggresive bouncers, can't the kids trip in peace anymore.  This would have gotten more stars but i disagree with the other reviewer who said the spun out kids were only a minor distraction, they Fuckin ruin this wonderful show.  The first 2 songs seem to be the worst.  Bellweather was the hightlight for me.  To experience LOtus you must go, not download.	lotushead	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2007-11-03 13:12:10-04
66564	12994	8	Amazing Show	This show was off the hook!  Both sets were great and the park West is the best venue in Chicago!\n\nHowever, the source does have some issues that are stated.  But it is still worth owning!	bisco2	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2007-11-03 21:54:31-04
66565	12994	8	great show	this show was great and the recording does not capture how great it really was. park west rocks.\ncrowd brought the kackle\ni also was wonderin if you had any way to post the pictures of the individual because think i know who they might be and im interested \nthanks let me know	chicagoshuffle	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2007-11-12 02:14:48-05
66566	12994	6	Can't do it justice	What a show!  Those kids really made the recording bad. I remember them. Actually have some photos I didnt post showing them acting like D-bags. In the future people if any of you need to scream and I can understand that feel move away from the recording devices.  Don't bend down and scream in them like these kids.  Thanks for the recording. Killer show!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2007-11-10 21:26:35-05
66567	12994	10	Hahaha	Yeah I'm friends with the kids you guys are talking about. Shit happens when you take too many xanies and drink. They honestly didn't know they were next to the taper(as retarded as that sounds), I tried telling them to move away but they were too far gone. One of the kids somehow got kicked out 3 different times and managed to get back in each time.	Mr Don	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2007-11-28 23:15:02-05
66568	12994	10	Chi town reppin	very good to see lotus getting into the loop of things and finally coming to chicago  ... come back  cant wait to see em pre sound tribe in    st. louis	STS9doug420	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2008-01-14 23:32:57-05
66569	12994	10	AWSOME SHOW!!!!!!	This show was amazing. I went and they just jammed. Cant wait till they come back. I also cant wait till soundtribes show at chi.	electroid family	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2008-01-17 23:16:40-05
66570	12994	6	tough break w/the crowd noise...	My first live Lotus show--it's nice to look back and be able to hear it again. Listening right now, the sound quality is generally really good. The bass is mostly upfront and sounds AMAZING, something that I don't often find in Lotus recordings (except for the early SBDs), but the constant shouting... Great show, but belligerent crowd. The vibes definitely seemed a bit off that night, in my opinion. Shut up and dance, people!! 5 stars for the performance (these guys never seem 'off'), 3 for the frequent shouting that really brings the recording down. But I'm glad to hear this again, this show really turned me onto this great band, so thanks for taping/sharing!	psychedelicbrian	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2008-03-07 03:13:34-05
66571	12995	10	Nice work!	Nice work fellas! This sounds alot better than the other matrix. Sounds GREAT! Good Team Philly teamwork!	Bean420	2016-07-07 14:17:01-04	2007-02-13 02:55:14-05

66574	12997	8	DJ	I think it was like DJ Harry or something.  He was freakin good!\n\nLotus rocked the tent this night.  Man, I was impressed with the percussionist.	mulemaniac	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-06-15 16:38:50-04

66578	12997	10	One of Many Highlights this weekend!	Great music all weekend, best lotus show i have ever seen, rocked pretty hard.  Sick stuff from the boys of Lotus!  Keep Groov'n.	upthecanyon	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-06-17 18:24:14-04
66579	12997	8	ZELDA	Love the Legend of Zelda Theme, it even goes into the dungeon themes as well a little bit.  SICK stuff, very cool.  Not a bad set list either, but the sound is a little bassy.  one of the best shows at this years Wakarusa, glad to see it up so soon.  They threw down earlier as well if anyone has that one.	KottkeKU	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-06-18 05:27:46-04
66580	12997	10	Great show!	I thought they played Imagine?  Was it the other night they played or am I thinking of a different band all together.  That night was fuzzy...	jammin-man	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-07-03 01:00:59-04
66581	12997	8	LOTUS!!	Lotus killed it as usual.. they remain the undisputed kings of late night. If you went to Bassnectar.. you f'ed up, bad. I think their first late night of '06 was one of the best late night festival sets ever. This show is sweet, and they def. did not play 'Imagine'.... maybe you had too much too fast.	StringCheeseMcGee	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-07-17 17:22:33-04
66582	12997	10	Amazing	I was lucky enough to see this show live and it was by far the best show i saw at waka. Im very glad to have stumbled into the revival tent at 2 15 AM to catch this one	Rizzy	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-08-24 02:27:44-04
66583	12997	10	nematode	wow, what a great version of Nematode, very electric!  Lotus owns Waka every time they are there...this is a fantastic show!	dizzy izzy	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-10-14 20:47:48-04

66585	12998	8	One of the show's best sets	I just got back from the (rained out) second night of JOTR (more like Jam IN the River) and I gotta say I enjoyed myself the most on this set. Listen for Block Rockin' Beats and Flower Sermon.	americanhippos	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-05-28 02:49:10-04
66586	12998	8	yeahhhhh	this was one of my fav sets of the weekend	Lakai2788	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-05-29 16:42:00-04
66587	12998	10	tip of the tongue explains it all	lotus' set was amazing, they tore it up from beginning to finish. every single person was feelin it. it was definitely something to remember considering the biscuits got rained out which i wasnt disappointed bc lotus was great	echels420	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-05-30 19:32:42-04
66588	12998	10	asdf	The audio quality is pretty shitty but the set is so good that i dont fuck- its some of the best lotus ive heard\n\nIt almost made up for the disco biscuits getting rained out\n\nallmost...	Alex P.	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-05-30 20:20:03-04
66589	12998	8	Flower Sermon!	Wooo! For me usually seeing Lotus is the highlight of the weekend, this was no exception. Even though Lotus only had an hour set they brought the heat. Spritualize opener got things cookin' fast. Block Rockin' Beats was really cool, happy I got to see the boys tackle this one (especially since it was one I had called earlier that morning). Gonna Fly Now (Rocky Theme) was actually funky as fuck with Mike tossing in some slinky porno funk grooves in the background. Flower Sermon however was the highlight of the set for me. The whole place, from the stages to the very top of the stone stairs was  getting down to that song. Recording is sort've meh, but its just nice to have this set on disc.	phillycheeseblunt	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-05-31 17:06:45-04
66590	12998	10	Sweetness	The vibe out in the Philadelphia that afternoon was straight cooling out. Lotus setting it off with the Spiritualize really matched the feel of the day. I absolutely love these guys check em out. This show is pretty short but definitely worth a DL. Want to hear Lotus at its finest definitely pick up Bill's Bar 12/26/05. Smoothness...

66591	12998	0	agreed - best set at jotr	they really rocked out, i love this band.  i wish lotus got the chance to rock out 3 hour long late-nite sets instead of the early afternoon short ones, because the were the best.  every time i was not hearing music all weekend, i was bopping to "spiritualize" in my own head.	amberlyn2001	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-06-05 07:48:13-04
66592	12998	10	Lotus Needs More Time to rock	Unfortunatly this inst a review as I am just starting to listen to this recording as i write this, but it is a rant on the amount of stage time Lotus is given at fests...  I have gone to most of thier shows in california over the years and I am routinely dissappointed by the length of Lotus sets.  This music takes me to another place and once it takes me thier I never want to leave...\n\nTHank you for all the great times lotus.	StoneySageBoy	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-07-10 23:21:58-04
66593	12998	10	to comment further	i wanted to add to the previous rating... Lotus really does not get enough time at festivals, however if u do want to see them at their best go see them at Mr Smalls or a small venue where they can really spread their wings bc they play the heavy  heat	daBiscoLotusSector	2016-07-07 14:17:02-04	2007-09-06 15:52:21-04

66623	13014	10	Fire! Fire!!	Lotus was on fire at this show!!All of us Columbians had a grate time!!Wish I wouldn't have had heat and smoke issues toward the end,but I must say this show is one of the raginest yet from the good folks of Lotus!!Thanks to all that helped to maker the magic of the evening!!	ohiodanielle	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2007-05-01 21:54:13-04
66595	13004	10	Simply awesome.	This show was awesome, the venue was sweet, sound qualtiy was fantastic, I was smashed, and Lotus was spreading the vibes.  I have been seeing Lotus since 2002, I first saw them in the fall of "02" at Murray's Inn in Wilkes-Barre.  From then until now the progress, innovation, and experimentation that Lotus has been doing for the last couple years has improved their individual and collective performances to the highest quality.  Amazing, keep up the good work Lotus.	Jagerrulez	2016-07-07 14:17:05-04	2007-11-26 21:46:23-05

The sound on this recording isn't as "in your face" at Peter's other source (Schoeps mk4v), but true to  omni's - they really deliver a lot more of the feel of the show.  For the purists who aren't as interested in the experience, you'll want the card source.  For the people looking to relive the performance in its full glory then this one is where it's at.  Much more of the crowd reaction captured, like during the Sunrain > Around.\n\nThanks for sharing this one Peter,	Brad Leblanc	2016-07-07 14:17:05-04	2007-08-04 22:15:04-04

This was my fourth Lotus and it really blew me away.  There were so many different types of people there, all diggin the sounds.  Following Lotus was Dark Star Orchestra.  What a weekend.  I noticed the speakers cut out quite a bit, Copper needs to step it up next yr.  The price was right though. FREE!	swerveburd	2016-07-07 14:17:07-04	2007-05-24 23:54:11-04
66616	13013	10	Spoiled....	With all the tasty Lotus SBDs that have been showing I've gotten spoiled.  Don't let it happen to you!  This is a GRATE audience recording!

66617	13013	8	A Chill Show	Very chill for a Lotus show - the 39 min. Umbilical Moonrise > Mikesnack Jam > Lucid Awakening > Mikesnack > Lucid Awakening is a must listen.  Very funky, but level early, more atmospheric in the 2nd set. This is a nice show b/c it is so open, subtly-lax and mind-bending.	FlowFeel	2016-07-07 14:17:07-04	2007-02-18 04:02:27-05
66618	13013	10	nice	This is very nice. The energy that night was so HIGH and everybody was real poz and dancing and groovin so nice. nice set lotus this + last year is the shitttt\np.s.

66620	13013	10	Heat	This show is hot.  An A+ recording job and an A- for the playing.  The only negative part of the show is some really annoying people in the audience.  Some girl is making these ridiculous bird calls (?) throughout the second set, and some dude-brah yells a lot during the end of a song (can't remember which one).  Only minimal distractions though.

66621	13013	10	amazing.	sounds like a soundboard, one of the best recordings i've pulled off of this site in a while. plus lotus is just disgusting.

And what a Magical Night it was..Lotus brought it in a big way for the spring tour closer(and the last 2 set show for awhile!). The crowd was on fire at Mr Smalls this night..total shananigans indeed! Set 1 was great..Set 2 Was of Legend. Just Download It..I promise you wont be sorry. The Fact that the sound Quality on this boot is Phenomenal doesnt hurt either!..Thanks again Bean! and thanks to everyone at the show who made a night like this happen!

I don't remember the last couple songs or ruining your night so let me know the next time you see Lotus so we can bury the hatchet.	thatkid	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2007-05-02 00:54:29-04

66630	13014	10	HOT	Unfortunately I was not able to make this show...however on a whim and word of mouth i copped this download. Let me tell you it flat out kicks ass. To me, Lotus always seemed to stick to a more jazz-fusion sound without much progression and improv. However, recently (along with the Jam on the River 5/26/07 show) they have been really catching their groove creating explorative tracks worked with thick instrumentation. From start to finish this show just glides right through.\n\nMy personal fav's are "Marisol" and "The Last Hurrah" from the first set. Crowd goes bananas after those back to back. A+ recording as well.	PastPresents	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2007-06-19 20:05:02-04
66631	13014	8	solid	Wish I'd been at this one. Having seen them last in April, it's been too long. This show makes me jonesy. It's got a great groove and solid sound quality.	4kg/m3	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2007-09-05 02:23:41-04
66632	13014	10	PERFECT SOUND !!!	Gotta love this freebie, thanks alot for this...\nsorry Bean about that boot word... I'll never use it again in my vocabulary.	CHARLIE73	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2008-06-08 22:17:48-04
66633	13014	10	The word "bootleg".......	Folks. First off, Ia ppreciate all of teh kind reviews. This show was DOPE and the recording luckily came out to match the energy of teh night.\n\nSecondly, the word "bootleg" really irks us tapers. Bootleg is a word stemming from someone who illegally records a musical performance and then turns and sells it for a personal profit. The word "bootleg" does not apply to teh jamband world because the music/shows are ALLOWED to be recorded LEGALLY and us tapers DO NOT SELL the recordings. They are distributed freely and we DO NOT make a personal profit :) These are just considered free live music downloads ;)\n\nSorry, but as a longtime taper of this types of music, it really irks us tapers as a whole, because the word bootleg is thrown at the lowest form of tapers. And we are not even close to that league of taper ;) We are the 'Good Tapers' and give our recordings away for free, juts like it was meant to be :) Please don't take this the wrong way folks. I am not trying or intending to be some 'elitist taper' or anything like that. I am just educating you, the fans, on the labeling of shows you can get freely, as 'bootleg's. It simply gives us tapers a bad name in most respects :) Have a great night and everyone enjoy this fine download :) \n\nP.S.-I wish lotus would come back to Mr. Smalls(or ANYWHERE in Pittsburgh) again soon. They used to frequent Mr. Smalls at LEAST 2-3 times a year, once in the spring, once in the summer, once in the fall, and usually once in the winter time. But last year they played only twice(This show, and the 6/6/2007 Free Arts Fest show) and thats it. And they havent played da burgh since then :'( This was their last 2-set show in Pittsburgh. That sucks for the Lotus fans of the Burgh :( Please come back soon Lotus :'(	Bean420	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2008-05-02 07:29:22-04

They probably won't play a very long set but hopefully that means it'll be FOCUSED.  It'll be my first time seeing them outside of Illadelph, as I'm moving to Pitt in a few days\n\nNice recording---see you around at shows perhaps	Jebez	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2008-05-17 14:49:00-04
66635	13014	8	Yessir!	Wow - I hadnt gotten to this one yet. Thx Mike D! Perfect Friday booster! \n\nNicely designed set list. That is the foundation of this show. Starts off gentle, but gets serious quick. ebbs and flows sweetly. The band's execution is pinpoint, but organic. Gentle exolorations with crisp movement. Its hard to mark the high points when there are no low points!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2009-10-23 22:22:04-04

66637	13015	8	Solid Colo. Afternoon Set	One of the toughest things about bands like Lotus who bring high energy all the time, is balancing that in an early-in-the-day set.  The band has learned how to do that nicely.  Sweet B-day wishes to the Spider-man, Stevo!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2007-09-30 00:07:54-04

Hardest I've ever danced in my life...thank you Lotus and come back west asap!	Rent	2016-07-07 14:17:08-04	2007-11-13 02:52:37-05

We didn't do any of the optional night shows because we didn't want to spend any more than we already did.\n\nWe got there real early that first day and had camp set up by 11 am and got wasted.  we walked in on lotus ripping it up - we really wanted to check out the festival grounds before catching any music but they pulled us right in and then it was music music music for the next 72 hours.\n\nPoint being: this download is a must - as well as the Wiespread set that has popped up on another site, the moe. set, galactic, Franti, sound tribe, the biscuits, Toubab Krewe and P Groove off the top of my head are the highlight sets of the festival. Thanks to the tapers and hope to see you kids at 10000 lakes or waka waka - either way you know i'll be at bisco hunter mountain moedown and vibes - peace	HungryBob	2016-07-07 14:17:09-04	2007-03-14 16:04:12-04

66647	13020	10	The omni's put you right there...	The sound on this recording isn't as "in your face" at Peter's other source (Schoeps mk4v), but true to  omni's - they really deliver a lot more of the feel of the show.  For the purists who aren't as interested in the experience, you'll want the card source.  For the people looking to relive the performance in its full glory then this one is where it's at.  Much more of the crowd reaction captured, like during the Sunrain > Around.\n\nThanks for sharing this one Peter,\n\n-Brad	Brad Leblanc	2016-07-07 14:17:09-04	2007-08-04 22:09:18-04
66648	13022	6	Grayrigg!	i love grayrigg and they never play it enough for me, so funky!  nice to see a new song not from hammerstrike, vancouver island has some potential for growth and will surely be a rager soon.  one last hurrah has a nice little jam.\noverall great recording! no distortion and everything is fairly equal in the mix, thanks kenny!\n\nthree stars for a fairly average show, no complaints about the AUD recording	forbin723	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-10-21 21:53:18-04
66649	13022	8	thanks kenny!	sweet set list and good recording.  One of the guitars is a little quiet (I think Luke could be Mike though) but overall solid.	warner,st	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-10-21 22:59:15-04
66650	13022	0	Flagstaff show October 14, 2008	any live recordings floating around from Flagstaff.  That show rocked with a sick Spiritualized and TOTT.  Wondering if it will be out there at all?	student_of_life	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-10-22 03:33:23-04
66651	13022	8	Jams	There is def. some nice experimentation in these jams. Greyrigg is smoking, extra spicey! Very good pretty chill show - right by the beach I guess - :) 	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-10-22 15:27:54-04
66652	13023	10	Best of the Best.	Incredible Quality Matt thank you so much for such a hasty upload. The show reached every bit of the potential it was hyped up to be and so so much more. Starting off was the Flower Sermon threw the crowd right into the zone.\n\nThe new tracks GreyRigg, Age of Inexperience, and 72 hours awake have really come into their own. I sincerely love the direction Lotus is bringing their music.\n\nAlkaline with Kypski was awesome. Its almost impossible to break that track out in the future without someone scratching up a storm behind it. \n\nPersonal favorite of the night had to be the Plant Your Root > Umbilical Moonset > Sunrain Ending. The segues were executed flawlessly and the dance party that erupted as a result to the seamless raw jam was unreal. When you see serious crowd surfing at a Lotus concert...you know people came ready to party. \n\nThe Rage cover was also really tight and Greet the Mind as an encore was a great choice. All around incredible night, great recording, and great set list...worth the 5. \n\nHaha tanks raging Irving Plaza post show was also great times.

66655	13023	10	What a great two nights	I was able to attend the troy, ny show the night before this one and it was absolutely insane.\n\nOne of the spaciest Lotus shows I've seen.\n\nSo pissed I didn't make it to new york.\n\nLotus is one of the filthiest sounds in the scene right now, I cant wait to see them throughout the entire summer.	motus the mind	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-04-11 19:29:37-04
66656	13023	6	4-9 Lawrence, KS show	Love the this band very much..went to a royals/yanks game in kc/mo then drove to Lawrence only to watch Lotus play an awesome short set..they stopped playing at 12:30 at the Bottleneck!..usually the venue makes the band stop..looks like they were more interested hanging out and selling merch than playing to the crowd..made me glad I didn't drive up to Neb. when they played there last time..look forward to see em' at Wakarusa anyhow.	gimmetheball	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-04-11 02:04:59-04
66657	13023	10	!!	Incredible Show. Setlist was out of this world. Taping is crystal clear quality really great pull. \n\nGimmetheBall I don't know if you noticed, but this is a review for Ny. Don't mean to be rude, but this is where you give your imput on the performance and sound quality of the show that you are reviewing. If you want to talk about your own experience elsewhere put no rating...because clearly the 3 stars has nothing to do with this particular performance. 3 stars maybe if you don't have a pulse. \n\nLove the GreyRigg new jam. Spiritualize rocked...but yeah as was mentioned the Plant Your Root > Moonset > Sunrain was absolutely bananas. Also really digged the Frequency opening up. Guys are air tight. \n\nThis is a must DL.

66658	13023	8	A+ setlist	I really wish Lotus would have played this setlist in Lawrence the other night. Opening with Flower Sermon, you guys are so lucky.  Bellweather is a good one too.  Sound quality isnt from the board, but if you turn it up loud this show rules!  Lotus is so hot right now.... Hansel.	KottkeKU	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-04-11 05:36:07-04

66660	13023	10	Beyond Words	Lotus is growing in talent, passion, and creativity at a rate second to none. It is only a matter of time before they are the Omega of the scene. They play with a clear sense of purpose. They have the unique ability to fuse several different genres of music on a whim and in many cases in the same song. This is not Jamtronica...this is so so much more. I have been listening to this band since highschool back in 2001 packed in a small attic stage in Pittsburgh called Club Laga. You could have not fit more than 40/50 people in there with a crowbar. Now they are damn near selling out every venue they hit across the country. Not because of the hype, but because of their incessant drive to perform and play every place they go to the very best of their ability. There is no hiatus on the horizon for this band...things have only just really begun. I'm glad I was able to watch them grow into the beautifully well oiled dance machine they have become. \n\nPersonal favorites of the show...spiritualize, greyrigg, and Bellweather. Bring the funk Luke you damn pimp =). See you all at Mountain Jam. Peace and Love.\n\nRenee	CaliKrush	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-04-12 03:31:54-04

The whole show was really good but those two songs really stick out in my mind.\n\nThe sound quality on this recording is a tiny bit distorted and there's a bit of crowd noise.  Other than that, it's a great show.	Smalkmus	2016-07-07 14:17:10-04	2008-04-14 04:26:19-04

66667	13025	8	Great	This show was a blast... me and a bunch of my heady folk came up from Omaha to catch this show and we had a blast.\nI can't recall a crowd grooving so hard as they were during the second set closer "wax"\nthis show is a great one, and the recording isn't too bad at all, a bit o crowd noise and distortion, but still an all around great show\ndef recommend this one if your a lotus fan or just love to get down!!

66673	13028	10	Incredible time	Mike blasted off on that Hammerstrike to a whole other level...and Jessy put in some seriously thick and funky basework. Incredible day set thatreally matched the vibe out there at Summer Camp. It was full of energy and packed with some really exploratory jams really sending off tracks like Greet, Sunrain, and Jump Off in new and refreshing directions. Sincerely appreciate such a hasty upload. Really smooth pull with nice base. Summer Lotus...very nice.	CaliKrush	2016-07-07 14:17:12-04	2008-06-02 17:24:31-04
66674	13028	10	Great	Could not have said it any better Cali. Beautiful time...dance party afternoon style in the sun was awesome. Mad love for all Summer Camp family out there...that place was officially rockin.  Lotus has the power to walk into places and just take over with their clean vibe and incredible dance Groove. Type of band you hate to see leave the stage. Great set at SummerCamp...set list and new improv brought the heat. Jesse is the man. \n\nThanks for the upload!

66675	13028	10	Lips at Summer Camp?	First off, I was at Summer Camp and this show was for sure one of the hottest sets of the festival.  Secondly, did anyone out there tape the Flaming Lips show from Summer Camp?  Any clue where I could find it since I know the Lips are not posted on this site.

66676	13028	10	Wow	After being a sts9 fan for awhile, nice to hear new bands to follow.  These guys were on fire at the camp.  Hopefully they will get multiple sets in the future like other bands.  As for the Flaming Lips, I'm not sure about the audio, but a video feed from Iclips.net will have them and Lotus, sts9, Tea Leaf Green and a whole bunch others archived on their site.	stainedinky	2016-07-07 14:17:12-04	2008-06-03 11:57:26-04

66689	13030	10	MARISOL	Sickest, nastiest, dirtiest, most uplifting and influential Marisol ever done. Mike's level of innovation and sense of purpose on that guitar has cemented him as one of the rising stars on the scene. That is how you bring down the house with one track. \n\nDL this...the Marisol alone makes it worth it not to mention a jaw dropping Nematode and a nearly 30 min Its all Clear > Greet > Umbilical Moonrise > Greet!\n\nThe clarity of this recording is superb. Thank you so much for the wonderful pull. Sounds like a matrix =).	CaliKrush	2016-07-07 14:17:12-04	2008-04-29 17:21:17-04
66690	13030	8	Indeed	This show is as mentioned below. Good setlist, good sound(not Great), good energy. About the nastiest Marisol... its good but I just cant get over the sound and vibe of the first Marisol played on 9/27/06. But this show is definitely worth a listen.

66707	13037	10	Thanks bean	The set was raging. The Spiritualize kickoff is always a great and had people getting down right off the bat. The Age of Inexperience also was surprisingly solid...you guys have raised that song to completely new heights (Was previously one of my least favorite of the new tunes). Of course the third Lucid > Zelda > Lucid is always fun. I've personally heard Zelda one to many times, but especially for new listeners its always a smash hit. However, the segue back from Zelda into Lucid was full of energy...then the floor dropped out of the build and right back into Lucid...had that place rocking. Marisol is a personal favorite of mine. Although some say they prefer to keep up the heated dance tempo, I always enjoy a heart felt ballad. The One Last Hurrah ripped it up really nicely...always picture that song being played to someone driving 150 mph with their top down, a 6 ft scarf, and the most obnoxious aviators on. The bellweather non stop dance party may have stolen the night...Luke funked the schmack out of that one. Sid > Suitcases...was a clean old school encore that kept the crowd moving. Might I add DiskoBean you are the man thanks for getting the pull and the clarity is superb!!\n\n\nAlmost forgot...the Shimmer and Out...beautiful stuff. Mike is on fire this summer.

66708	13037	8	Those one set wonders	Love the energy they kicked it off w/ on Spiritualize. Some nice experimentation! Really not digging Zelda anymore, would love to see another cover make it into the rotation. As always hard to put on a 1 setter, even harder in front of a unsuspecting crowd. This one sounds really good though. 	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:15-04	2008-06-23 03:38:55-04
66711	13039	10	Great setlist!!!!	As I hear some of this I now from the start that this is a great show....Man, 08 for Lotus seems to be THAT year....The year thats going to really prove they hold a high ground in the jamband scene...I am so happy for all this amazing music!!!\n\nThank you Lotus and tapers!!!	mistergyro	2016-07-07 14:17:15-04	2008-02-15 01:36:18-05
66712	13039	10	Thanks!	Spiritualize > Juggernaut > Spiritualize!\n\nAnd I must say Wooly Mammoth is the pimpest freakin track. Another great pull from a legendary winter run. Also really diggen that new track Age of Inexperience. Got a real nice groove to it and I'm looking forward to seeing where Lotus takes it with their funktastic improv. Juan Maclean Bubonic all day. Big thanks to Chris K for a great recording. Get it while its hot.	FreshFlavor	2016-07-07 14:17:15-04	2008-02-18 01:14:26-05
66713	13039	6	Tour ending	Didnt feel this show as much as others. Too much keyboard action for me.  The vibe of the show seemed short. Age of Inexperience is cool - sounds like a Spin Doctors song. Wooly Mammoth is a great song!  Second set heats up for sure.\n\nhttp://avantchicago.com	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:15-04	2008-04-06 18:34:00-04
66714	13041	10	Amazing	I know a lot of folks missed the lights of Lotus, but this show was t on par for the most beautiful outdoor I've ever seen.

Keep in mind that this was in the middle of the week at a venue not a festival so there weren't alot of party favors. The crowd kept going. Mike was on point all night. Wait for an explosion next time they come around that area	shaftz0r	2016-07-07 14:17:18-04	2008-08-08 09:46:58-04

66762	13060	8	First time seeing them	I thought they were great, really fun was up top for the first set and then down at the stage for the second. Apparently the night before was not as good in lancaster which saved me the trip from nyc.	moexploitation	2016-07-07 14:17:22-04	2009-05-01 22:35:24-04
66736	13052	10	Couldnt ask for More	What an incredible show! The energy was so think in the Dame you could have scooped it with a spoon. Personal highlights for me had to be that mind blowing One last Hurrah, a nice version of Simian, and the constant flares of Sunrain that occured throughout the show. Great shoutout to Harper as well before Flower Sermon..main man in the Lotus fam. The Spiritualize encore was a work of art. A must DL all around great quality.  Huge thanks to Paul and Kim for hooking up this pull =)!! This is one for the ages...enjoy.	FreshFlavor	2016-07-07 14:17:19-04	2008-02-11 03:04:09-05

66739	13052	0	what a night	the energy at the dame for this show was amazing...the entire lexington crowd was askin themselves why they never go see this band and no one had a good answer...the only good reason to not see this band was the dude in the green and yellow jester/egyptian/im a homo hat...that guy sucked... he spent so much time telling me how good lotus and telepath were i couldn't actually concentrate on how good they were...and if that guy reads this he needs to know that you probably shouldn't PUSH females out of your rail spot after you lose it while getting a drink...and it was me that put the dirt and shit in your beer while you were busy talking to people that wanted nothing to do with you...sorry for the rant...but this show was too amazing to almost be ruined by the "self appointed biggest lotus fan ever"...his words, not mine	col. phorbin	2016-07-07 14:17:19-04	2008-02-17 03:34:29-05

66744	13052	10	Great show	Incredible show. Traveled all the way over from Columbus to rock out with 5 people in the car covered in suitcases and debree. The expired Slang and the One Last Hurrah were absolutely unreal. You always gotta love the Spiritualize encore as well. Digged the hell out of Telepath to as the opener.

66753	13058	10	livingston storm out of this world	i feel like alot of the songs were rushed tonight, juggernaut was rushed but the livingston storm was just incredible really taken to another level. great recording, glad i got to here this one !	daned420	2016-07-07 14:17:21-04	2008-10-19 14:48:25-04
66754	13058	8	yet another awesome show!	I agree that the show did feel a bit rushed at times, but just the mere fact that they played Livingston Storm and Did Fatt flawlessly was enough for me fall in love once again...thanks for posting this!	Rent	2016-07-07 14:17:21-04	2008-10-19 20:40:19-04
66755	13058	8	Agreed	Parts seems a little rushed or off, but also there is some nice work in experimentation in Livingston, ITAC and TOTT. Also both Hammer and Didd Fatt were strong enough to save the set. Not a bad show - recording is good - thx for getting it up so quick!!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:21-04	2008-10-19 22:55:10-04
66756	13058	8	yes i	many of the songs do seem faster paced than normal, but i think the juggernaut is SMOKIN! luke is killing the synth on the jam.  ITAC is also the fire especially around the 7+ minute mark. right from the funky drum false starts you can tell TOTT is gonna be raging, and it most definitely is! \n\nthe recording is crisp and very enjoyable, thanks chucky!	forbin723	2016-07-07 14:17:21-04	2008-10-20 04:19:11-04

66771	13064	8	Fuck the house of blues	Lotus did a great job, but the venue was total fucks. Kicking Lotus off early, not letting the biscuits encore, harrassing me when I was in a wheel chair. I can assure you Lotus will not be playing there again despite how nice the venue was. Fuck House of Blues in AC!!!	ajssj	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2009-09-04 19:54:36-04
66772	13064	8	Lotus Live at the House Of Blues	Lotus's sound is a mix of electric guitar powered smooth jazz, rock and post rock. I really like how Louts performed at this show even though some of their sound (especially with their syths) were on the corny side of things from time to time. This type of music, as well put together as it is and as professionally played as it was is not something I regularly would even consider listening to.

66775	13066	10	Lotus!!!!	First time I caught an entire set of Lotus.  This show was sickness.  Great way to kick off All Good.	alienscapes	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2009-07-18 07:33:45-04
66776	13066	10	All Good was ALL GOOD	I love this around 5:30 of Lucid Awakening someone yells "Roll Tide!" in a really southern voice, which is funny to me as a University of Alabama student. \nThis was a great set, and my first time listening to Lotus.	neenjaoflove	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2009-07-21 04:19:17-04
66777	13066	8	Lotus was Terrific	I think they need to insist on the Allgood Stage next Year!!\n\nSend Buckethead to this one for late night on Thursday night.	PBD	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2009-07-21 20:36:27-04
66778	13066	10	amazing	lotus and keller were amazing that thursday.. ive actually been checking here and bt.etree since allgood for this set, thank you!	irPuMa	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2009-07-23 05:12:52-04
66779	13066	10	Agree with PBD!	I couldn't agree more, PBD!!!  They definitely should be on the main stage next year, these guys are sick and this was by far one of my favorite sets of the weekend.  Keller followed by Lotus late night Thursday was one heck of a great way to set off the festie!	rain3323	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2009-07-24 17:07:45-04

66781	13066	6	Too bad	Great show, but the tech issues are a drag. Good stuff though - the Spirit>Jugger>Spirit is snasty!  And dont throw glowsticks kids (or jellybeans)	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2009-07-29 23:26:05-04
66782	13066	8	good times	This show was a BLAST! Seen these guys a bunch and I wouldn't have had any other way to kick off and amazing weekend! From start to finish is tight!	Dan508	2016-07-07 14:17:24-04	2010-04-06 22:08:40-04
66783	13067	8	Nice quality	Saw the show the night before in Blacksburg, unfortunately wasn't taped officially and no AUD recording exists to my knowledge. Was kinda a small venue and shitty crowd, so I wasn't surprised there was no motivation to capture it.\n\nAnyway, this is a very good quality recording with a great Nematode>Plant>Wax. Worth checking out for that and The Surf, which I haven't seen that they've played it sense. Neat song.	sandman1687	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2010-08-25 20:24:55-04
66784	13067	10	Fire alarm	I was at this show also and remember the fire alarm going off. The band just kept on rolling. The band was tight (as always). Great recording as well. Thanks!	rover77	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2010-08-29 20:20:32-04
66785	13067	10	Thanks...	Your hard work doesn't go unappreciated!	Dickie2306	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2010-09-03 20:19:32-04
66786	13068	10	my third show	thanks Joel for posting these sets so fast.\nPgroove made my night, but I did enjoy Lotus too, especially after their crowd left!	Cleveland	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2009-02-23 12:42:26-05
66787	13068	8	Big fan	I've been a Pgroove fan longer than I have of Lotus but it always puzzles me when I meet people that think pgroove is better than Lotus, Tribe, and Bisco. They just seem so much deeper and original to me but i guess those people just like a more traditional sound. I've seen them all live many times and they're all good but i have the best memories from the latter 3. I definately wouldn't have left the show though. Those people are lame Pgroove is great it's just hard to match what those other guys do IMO.	snuau	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2009-02-24 17:49:13-05
66788	13068	0	Bad Security	The security sucked. I got kicked out before Lotus even came out over some accusations. Thanks for posting what I was expecting to be a great show! At least now I get to hear it. Please play at the Tennessee Theater next time though. That would be sweet!	JerodofTheCurrent	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2009-02-24 08:22:32-05
66816	13079	8	Jammin	Great setlist, one of the best "In An Outline"s I've heard. Nice quality recording.	sandman1687	2016-07-07 14:17:30-04	2010-12-03 03:16:24-05
66817	13081	10	Crazy show	I am pumped that this show is on archive. This show was so sweet there where so many people here just insane.	pajamas4-20	2016-07-07 14:17:31-04	2011-01-04 13:24:18-05
66818	13081	10	So jealous...	I wish they had played some of these for NYE, like Dowrn, Shimmer, Did Fatt, Bellwhether. Incredible quality recording, keep up the great work. Many thanks.	sandman1687	2016-07-07 14:17:31-04	2011-01-04 16:57:10-05
66789	13068	0	good show	i've seen Lotus several times, and they are in fact one of my favorite bands.  I feel that they played a really good show this night.  But then again they always do.  They are one of the tightest and most consistent bands i've ever seen. This isn't one of the best shows I've seen them play, but it was good nonetheless.  In regards to the crowd, I can absolutely promise you that the largeness, youth, inexperience, and generally manners-challenged crowd at the show was not due to lotus.  Most of the young kids(under 18) were there for pgroove.  Ive seen both bands several times in the South and this is almost always true for pgroove shows.  the fact that it was an all-ages show on a friday night only exaggerated this further.  the reason that the crowd thinned out was most likely due to the show running past midnight and then 1 a.m.  I'm sure that many of those kids had curfews.  There was almost nobody that young at the minglewood in memphis the night before when lotus was the only band (i.e. no pgroove).  just wanted to clear that up.  thanks for posting this up joel.	soulfulprism	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2009-02-24 23:37:56-05
66790	13068	10	Good recording	Simple set list but everything is spot on, very tight.  \n\nHigh quality recording and definitely a great show.  Being the only review who listened to the show and was not there, I'd say from the audio quality and sweetness of the band's playing, that this is definitely a must download show that I enjoyed immensely.  Shame about the newbies at the show tho, :P.  \n\nPeace out.	Lectrovibes	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2009-03-04 21:24:01-05
66791	13068	8	Great!	One of the better 1 set shows from Lotus. Nice recording. Great flow of the setlist and just top notch energy, sound and groove from the band! 	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:25-04	2009-04-06 05:25:41-04

66797	13071	10	crazy loud	I thought they rocked for second time seeing them. Half the reviews on shows I put in the Archive, I wasn't at the show but this one Id like to say I was at. Friend that went with me said they rocked and has never herd there music. Cant wait, Cant wait to hear this.	phishingbart	2016-07-07 14:17:26-04	2009-04-20 00:43:26-04
66798	13073	10	Great Show!	The performance is amazing, as is the sound quality, thanks for posting.  If this is New Year's Eve's Eve, I can't wait to hear the show from the 31st. These guys are the highest quality jam band playing right now in my opinion. Every one of their shows is so full of energy and performed at such a consistently high level.	boisemusicfan	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2010-01-07 00:01:14-05
66799	13073	10	nice!	Sounds as perty as that lineage looks ;-)  Great pull.	lost4good	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2010-02-08 18:47:46-05
66800	13073	10	Lotus pre-NYE show	This recording is one of the cleanest sounding pulls on archive.  Great job with the taping, oh ya the band doesnt sound half bad either :)\n\nGoing to check Lotus out at the 9:30 club tonight, hope they bring the heat like they showcased here.	kcmoeron09	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2010-02-13 17:39:36-05
66801	13073	8	Very Strong	Great show to warm up for the NYE banger. I mentioned this to the Lotus Message Board crew about Lotus making sure the taper got in to the sold out concert- shows a great respect for fans and the music. Thanks for taping!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2010-03-04 00:44:33-05
66802	13073	10	Nice recording	Missed this guy but saw 'em the next night in Philly, great show as always. This is a superb recording, however, and I think it sounds better than the E-Factory's SBD recording. I'm almost certain this is due to the venue differences though, as the E-Factory is basically a huge warehouse and thus sounds like one. Cheers!	sandman1687	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2010-08-24 20:29:05-04
66803	13074	10	A night of ecstasy	This show was my first Lotus show and they shattered my expectations not that they were low. Amazing live band I celebrate their entire collection. Thanks to Paul & Kim for recording this I'm the guy that got you to look after our jackets thanks for that as well. This show is soundboard worthy but my luck the recording harddrive had problems. Glad it got taped though.	snuau	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2009-03-07 05:48:15-05
66804	13074	8	Solid	Decent 1 set show. Solid recording. Love to see more super-sandwich segues ala the one near the end of the show!	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2009-03-08 23:18:04-04
66805	13074	10	Agreed...	Definitely enjoying the segues that Lotus has been throwing in....keep the jams going all night long!\n\nGood set list, good show.\n\nPeace 	Lectrovibes	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2009-03-09 00:25:28-04
66806	13075	8	Well done	If there was a thing as a greatest hits show - this would be it. Played well, perfect to impress 7K before the Biscuits! 	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:27-04	2009-07-12 01:03:52-04
66807	13076	8	Travel>Jugg	How nice it is to see travel and comptroller being busted out after a SWEET appearance for the NYE run, hopefully these two will stay in rotation! overall sound on this AUD is pretty good, levels are pretty well mixed, and the bass can be heard prominently (often a probelm with Lotus AUD recordings).  High energy show with some killer jams and a banging' setlist!	forbin723	2016-07-07 14:17:28-04	2009-02-15 17:01:19-05
66808	13076	8	Solid	Great show for the real tour opener. 1st set is very good. New songs. 2nd set end chronic! Aud is quality.	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:28-04	2009-02-15 20:16:13-05
66809	13076	10	sick!	Great weekend run, thanks for recording! Haven't seen Lotus in about 4 years and they were even better than last time I saw them. Friday night had great vibes!	andyman5000	2016-07-07 14:17:28-04	2009-02-16 21:24:56-05

66812	13076	10	Amazing	Lotus has been spot on and this show is no exception.  The audio is pristine and the new songs are rocking.  \n\nWax>Umbilical Moonset>Wax will blow you away! \nA must download and great start to the new tour.  	Lectrovibes	2016-07-07 14:17:28-04	2009-02-26 10:53:12-05
66813	13077	8	Day Timers	Set shows why Lotus could be a daytime headliner at a Fest. Perfect vibe for a sundown show. This one was mid afternoon in the blazin heat, but it was ragin!!!  Anyone have the late night set they played?	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:28-04	2009-09-04 20:16:51-04
66814	13077	8	Fun, but...	Really people. We need somebody to upload the late night set from the barn.  Literally hippie sweat dripping from above.  One-in, one-out capacity!  Damn! Best set by any band that fest!	scpsnow	2016-07-07 14:17:28-04	2009-12-25 03:41:44-05

66819	13081	10	thanks	hey thanks for this, great job. Did you record manhattan project? Would love to hear it if so. Please let me know (royalty33@charter.net) Frank really wants their music spread so if you dig them and can make a show and record just email them and they will take care of you.\nthanks	jaym1818	2016-07-07 14:17:31-04	2011-01-06 15:22:06-05
66820	13081	10	Great recording!	I am LOVIN' the Naiant Littlebox more and more. I get to use mine tomorrow for Trey for the 1st time. It sounds REALLY GOOD w/ the Milabs Seth :) Do you have IN/OUT Transformers or just a stock unit??? Hit me up at www.taperssection.com under 'Bean'.

66823	13082	10	Wow	For me Lotus completely stole the show at Moe.down. Lotus was full of energy and sounded beautifully.  I'm not sure if they made Moe less enjoyable to me but Moe seemed lifeless and boring the rest of the weekend after Lotus dominated this set . Bravo!	gibbonge34	2016-07-07 14:17:31-04	2010-09-14 13:46:37-04
66824	13082	8	First time	This was the first time i had heard lotus live, and ever since ive been a huge fan.great show lots of energy. when the set was done i look at the people around me and wondered how MOE. was goin to top their performance	dirock89	2016-07-07 14:17:31-04	2011-04-18 16:58:56-04
66825	13083	10	First Show!	Thanks to Iowataper for getting this show up so quickly! This was my first Lotus show and I hope to see more. I liked that they included many songs from Hammerstrike and the EP's as I'm most familiar with those albums. I had a photopass, so here are the pictures I took that night. I also shot some of The Family Groove Company.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/playbsides/sets/72157623388040403/	mikeroeder	2016-07-07 14:17:32-04	2010-02-26 22:48:46-05
66826	13083	8	Great Show	I thought this was an excellent show. It was the only one of the tour I caught. I was pleasantly surprised to hear Spiritualized; I thought it would have been played multiple times over their Midwestern run and thus I would miss it. Anyways, they put on a great, great show for such a small amount of people. I am glad I drove two hours for this one!\n\nTape sounds really good. Thanks Patrick. Nice to meet you!	aquabat414	2016-07-07 14:17:32-04	2010-02-27 19:19:14-05
66827	13083	8	Solid Work as Usual	As I posted on the Board - Got some key moments -\n\nBellwether >\nDowrn has some really good improv work.\n\nDid Fatt >\nShimmer & Out Love the jam and the $egue into $himmer. Cool And the jam in Shimmer is tasty!\n\nAnd the overall vibe of the show - has a more earthy, rock feel to it. (see Invincibility of Youth for sure) An interestingly executed setlist. I think the vast, gothicness of the theater must have brought out this feeling Wink	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:32-04	2010-03-08 06:27:30-05

66836	13086	10	Great Show	Great show, great recording. First time I've ever seen Lotus, and they were groovin hard the whole set!

66842	13089	10	On This Road We Travel	While I of course was very sad to see Chuck leave Lotus, I am impressed and excited by the new sounds Lotus is putting out. This show proves it. They are really tight in this one being the 3rd show of the tour. Of course playing Smalls is like home field advantage, but this is really well done show. (I dont give out fives too often!) \n\nAlso if you havent had the pleasure check out the web series - http://vimeo.com/lotusvibes	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:17:33-04	2010-10-23 04:22:50-04

66851	13091	10	progressing nicely	anyone who has seen, or even listened to, lotus in the last few months can see their transformation from a groovy and soulful yet calm jam band into a raging, face-melting, funky group who always seems to impress and slay.  one of the better jam bands on the scene as of now.	farone45	2016-07-07 14:17:34-04	2010-07-18 21:38:31-04

66867	13106	6	Meh middle show.	This was 2/3 show they did with STS9 in NYC, Boston, and Philly, and honestly, was the worst of the three. Mediocre setlist, Chuck was missing b/c he's having a baby in Denver, and an 8-min Flower Sermon WITH NO CHUCK. The only redeeming thing about this show is the Spiritualize, which was pretty sick.\n\nSound quality isn't too bad, a little low and muffled on the low end. I usually d/l shows I attend from livedownloads, but I think I'll skip this one.\n\nBig thanks to Brian V for taping. Would love to know if you got STS9's set, they fucking killed it.	sandman1687	2016-07-07 14:17:38-04	2010-08-17 16:14:54-04

66870	13106	8	Nice	I disagree with it being a mediocre setlist.  By mediocre do you mean not the same old setlist as usual? For the most part i think it's a great recording.	uselessknowledge	2016-07-07 14:17:38-04	2010-08-31 16:36:01-04
66871	13106	0	ugh	not going to rate because i dont know how good the quality of the recording is, BUT, this show was absolutely terrible. worst sound ive ever had the misfortune of hearing in a venue. avoid this place at all costs.	shaftz0r	2016-07-07 14:17:38-04	2010-10-26 18:16:08-04
66872	13108	10	Funk	This is why Lotus is the definition of jam.  Combining funk and jazz fundamentals with a new-age, hip-hop edge -- what's not to love.  What can I say, I'm a slave to the Lotus groove.  This is one of the very many great Lotus shows floating around on archive, and I can't wait to hear the very many more in the future.	farone45	2016-07-07 14:17:38-04	2010-09-07 20:39:59-04
66873	13108	10	track 5	so i love lotus but i lack any knowledge of the band and their songs. does anyone know what the title to track 5 is (is it even a lotus original?) whole show is great but im completely blown away by track 5.	stelladog	2016-07-07 14:17:38-04	2010-09-15 20:42:10-04

66889	13118	10	Outstanding.	This was my 7th time seeing lotus and the 4th time this year...Its amazing seeing the progress of this band as time goes by. The Bubonic Tonic opener was a really high energy start to the show, and they kept it going for the rest of the set. Middle Road was so sweet to hear, haven't heard it since my first time seeing them at the Boulder Theater on April 17th, 2010.\n\nAll Clear to Me Now totally blew my mind to pieces...the way they totally mellowed it down into silence before blasting off into the face melting uptempo ragefest was absolutely flawless. \n\nUnfortunately I missed Greet the Mind because I went with my girlfriend to move her car...but when we came upstairs the lights were going crazy! Their light setup now is top notch, totally chill but excitingly psychedelic at the same time. Their second set seemed to bounce a little bit more than the first one, with some insane jams in there. Mike gave me the setlist after the show...that sandwich is friggin ridic. Flower Sermon > F# jam > trip (idk what this is supposed to mean) > Dowrn  > Sermon with accents in F# > Accents B > Sunrain. Whoa. Its cool to see that they have certain stuff written on the setlist to let the band know what kind of jam section will be coming up. I also noticed a lot of communication between Jesse and Luke up there. Everything was on point.\n\nThere was very little mistakes, and even the mistakes that were made were subtle and they did a great job of playing them off. It was like they somehow worked with the song. The encore was dope, super bassy, dancy goodness. Definitely the best Lotus show I have seen/heard and probably one of the best shows I have ever seen period.	Garciarrhea	2016-07-07 14:17:42-04	2011-11-14 03:21:26-05

66915	13159	10	Terrific set for the last night	By far the tightest Lotus set I've seen, even better than '09 (in my personal opinion of course). Awesome recording quality, tapers are really stepping up their game these days.	aarodynamics	2016-07-07 14:17:54-04	2012-07-27 00:23:53-04

66918	13159	10	LOTUS ALL GOOD 2012 BEST SHOW EVER	This was by far one of the funnest shows i've ever been too.  Lotus absolutely killed it at all good this year!   The mile long glow stick line that formed during the show and the parachute was insane!!!!!!!	TheFearlessFool	2016-07-07 14:17:54-04	2012-11-17 20:10:37-05
66919	13159	8	Awesome Show. Great Memories!	Thanks Rob Clarke for uploading this and bringing back some awesome memories from this summer. Wow, can't believe All Good was about a half a year ago already!\n\nThis was my highlight of All Good, while Lettuce, Papadosio and Galactic were great, Late Night Lotus is what had me amped from May until All Good.\n\nOnly bad thing about the show for me was as soon as the opening notes to Spiritualize kicked in I had this instant feeling that I had to throw up so I had to dash to the porta-potties from my spot on the rail. Haha I made it back quickly to a closeby spot. Also thanks to the whichever poster for bringing up the glowstick/parachute chain. Holy crap I forgot all about that. \n\nMuch love to all the peeps I met there, especially the dude with the Mikesnack sign!\n4 Night Lotus Run in January WOOT!	branderson	2016-07-07 14:17:54-04	2012-12-27 23:41:41-05

66921	13160	10	Awesome Show	Quality is good i love the crowd noise throughout, makes me feel like I'm there again!  This was the 2nd lotus show I'd been to besides Halloween 2011! Amazing second set, gravitated me towards the front and I couldn't stop moving!  Thank you so much for this recording, now I can re-live this show again and again!

66923	13164	8	Sorry Taper	I was very excited to see Lotus in the town I lived in and was yelling a decent deal during the show, prompting multiple "shushes" from you.  Thanks for taping this show.  The energy it brought to the festival was great.  Electric Avenue tease during Bubonic was hilarious.  Nematode opener ruled. 	Jewbacca	2016-07-07 14:17:55-04	2016-05-17 05:57:07-04
66924	13165	10	Thank You!	Although its only a partial set you are still able to relive the beginning of what evolved into an magical night. The energy in the Newport was absolutely outstanding, and Lotus's professionalism shined through all night long.	RDub4	2016-07-07 14:17:55-04	2013-02-04 20:48:47-05
66925	13165	10	loved Lotus at the Newport!	Would have loved to have captured the entire set, but my gear was getting beat up badly by the crazed fans. I was not familiar with Lotus at all, but I became an instant fan. They truly rocked the Newport.	zupanic	2016-07-07 14:17:55-04	2013-02-04 21:29:21-05

66930	13167	8	Great sounding recording, but...	Wish there was more bass.  A bit tinny, not enough Jesse, for example - Suitcases should just ROLL through that opening bassline.	Brad Leblanc	2016-07-07 14:17:56-04	2013-11-14 15:57:54-05
66931	13168	10	Great Show!	Larry, fantastic recording as usual - keep it up!\n\nLotus is at their peak right now, and this is a great example of how they continue to kill it every show!\n\nWorth a listen, and absolutely worth going to see them live any chance you get!

66946	13188	10	Amazing recording Scott :)	No offense to Ted Gakidis or Rob Clarke, but this source blows the other two out of the water :) If only there were a Schempz source too hahaha lol :)\n\nAnyway, great capture Scott. You know how I love my mk41 Supercards/Hypercards too. Just so damn precise and in your face!\n\nThanks again Scott, amazing recording, from one taper to another ;) Keep up the great work and I'll hopefully run into you and Jen sooner than later :)\n\nBean\n\nP.S.- Scott, I use heavy duty metal stakes I found at a local hardware store called Busy Beaver, here in Washington, PA! They fit PERFECT around my stand legs and I can drive my stand into the ground to where it would take someone physically falling directly into my stand HARD for it to be taken down and knocked over. Def worth the $10 it cost me for [3] stakes per stand :) Just an FYI. But as a longtime taper too, I know some things CANNOT be avoided though ;)	diskobean	2016-07-07 14:18:02-04	2014-09-10 20:05:25-04

66948	13190	4	Fantastic show, bad quality 	This was one of the best shows Ive ever been to. The talking heads set was just perfect, I don't think there could be a more perfect band to cover Talking Heads. \n\nHowever, the quality of this recording is really bad. I don't know where the source of it is from. There used to be a full video of the show on youtube with A+ quality, but it was taken down. I ripped the show from that video, and even at 248kbps, it is miles better than this one. 	Filthy Concertgoer	2016-07-07 14:18:03-04	2015-07-23 03:53:49-04
66949	13195	10	Banger!	I am only 3 songs deep and I can already feel my shoes starting to smoke. This is a hell of a show to hold up a hell of a setlist on what is already proving to be a hell of a tour. Audio quality on this version is MUCH higher than the other version available - many thanks to the tapers and those involved in mastering. \nIf this is any omen of things to come this weekend at the Fillmore in Denver we're in for a treat.	like_zoinks	2016-07-07 14:18:05-04	2014-02-04 18:30:07-05

66951	13197	10	Best set of the Vibes!	Hard to pick one set out of all the amazing sets at 2014's Vibes, but I have to say this Lotus set blew me away more than anyone else. That 20min Spiritualize alone is worth the price of admission, not to mention the wonderful experimenting on all the Talking Heads' music.	Funcrushed	2016-07-07 14:18:06-04	2014-08-05 13:04:43-04
66952	13197	4	Great concept	Cool freakin grooves and just an electronic heads cover show= a 4 star. But they could have done way better for the vocals! I give the dude credit for trying, but it just kinda kills it. I know  the talking heads guy is charismatic singer maybe and hard to pull off, so I am not meaning to be harsh. All good, I am sure it was a blast at the time.	Oceans in Space	2016-07-07 14:18:06-04	2014-08-10 05:57:57-04
66953	13197	10	captivating	For many of us, this was THE set at the Vibes.  Once it gets going, it's all magic.  I Zimbra > Spiritualize is brilliant.	coronaborealis	2016-07-07 14:18:06-04	2014-08-14 01:51:07-04

And, significantly so!  Thank you for a great recording of a great show.	nostromo53	2016-07-07 14:18:09-04	2015-09-18 16:04:17-04

66957	13212	0	Phase Corrected Files	With only a few All Good shows left to upload, I discovered that all of the recordings I made at All Good were initially out of phase due to a tiny switch on my preamp being knocked out of position before the festival started.  The initial recordings don’t sound as good as they can with the phase reversed…particularly when listening through speakers (due to phase cancellation).  The new files were uploaded around 8/20/15, so if you grabbed this show prior to then, you might want to re-download.

66969	12907	10	Best of run	We caught 4 shows on this run.  Missed Boulder because Boulder sucks.  A bicycle lane?  You can't be serious.  Boulder sucking aside, this show was the exact opposite of the city of Boulder.  This was the best one I saw.  These guys are also starting to jam a bit more.  Before, the songs were much more composed and the jams were fun, yet too restrained.  These jams are much more emotional.  Check out Plant>Shimmer.  Lots of heat.\n   Thanks for getting this SBD up here.  Sound is hard to beat, like a sore pecker.  And thanks for a solid stretch of shows in CO.  Please get to/near TN since I'm leaving CO, too.  The chicks look better there.  Is that incentive enough?	helicopter33	2016-07-07 14:30:46-04	2006-03-02 13:11:35-05

66973	12907	10	good show	best of the CO winter run for sure.  had the privelage to be front row at this show and it blew my away.  The one lotus show really none of my friends hit up except me.  what a bummer for them. But yeah the 1/2 time is very sick and shows how Luke and the the rest of the band are really starting to expore their instruments in different ways. Plant>Shimmer and Flower>Space in between>Sermon is also off the wall.  Check this show out for sure and check out Lotus when they roll through your town.\nGood recording but a little muffled for a SBD. Thanks so much for posting!

66981	13031	10	Here's how you get to know Lotus	Not every show brings the heat dance floor banger song aftr song. This shows the ability of Lotus to drop tight jams, experiment a little and musically put it on. The kind of set designed well for a festival headlining spot, not a late night rager. This is Lotus doing what they do....Quality recording.	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:30:46-04	2008-08-07 02:50:08-04
66982	13031	10	A True Must Hear.	This night at NLQP will for sure go down in the all-time books for Lotus fans. Magical comes to mind. Unique. Perfect. Lets add it up: 1. NLQP is the most beautiful and hospitible spot you could hope for for a midsize summertime fest. A quarry to swim in, cliffs to jump off, trees to camp in, no long walking to anything, and a true family ownership that has deep roots in ohio. 2. Perfect weather all weekend. 3. Tons of Lotus Family in full force and a very pumped and danceready crowd otherwise, as always! 4. Lotus brought the Heat 110% and never looked back. From a debatebly perfect setlist..to flawless, mature improvs/jam sections and transitions..to moments of insanity and almost industrial/heavy metal(listen to parts of micksnack and hammerstrike! Mikey is so on fire i thought his guitar was gonna turn into a demon and eat our souls!)..to straight down and dirty funk stylee.. they covered so much ground, interpreting old material in new fresh ways, with a handfull of slightly newer songs, but in a way where the entire night had a cetain feel and flow to it that was all one cohesive unit. The Playing all around was superb and imo this will truely be considered an all time great Lotus show for years to come. The Recording itself is as flawless as the show, which makes this all the more worth it. The Universe (and Bean!) was making sure this night could be enjoyed, at least vicariosly, for everyone out there who has any sense of Lotus at all. Im not kidding, this is a true must own show.  The Set 1 Intro Improv set the mood for the entire night..listen and get the jist of that feel and you'll have a indication of where this is all going..which they took right into a smooth and slower Nematode, ever so slightly flubbing the transition(hey if im gonna give it a 5 and hype it up i gotta point out whatever flubs i can..when u listen i doubt youll even notice!), continuing the subtle danceparty vibe they set up, slowly building into the first signs of rage for the night before dropping back into the main theme and ending it. Then the familiar banjo sounding notes of Reich! Again continuing the slow estatic dance party as the sun was setting now..a very solid reich indeed..right into Slow Cookin'..good good version also, calm..then funky..then slowly building into the first full on electronica of the night right into Moonset!! perfection. controlled. mature. building into a deep rage at the end. Very Nice. Next Came Livingston. I gotta say they for sure were outta synch for the first 2-3 min or so, which would be this only nights blatant nonperfection, but man do they recover. First its a farily normal storm..building into this weird almost aboriginal industrial weirdness. Lukes just usuing these wicked crazy tones underneath Mikeys usual Storm tones..its really interesting. Then whats this..like 30 secs or so of some bonafide feedback/space that drops right into a Sick Sick Sick Mikesnack! Man this ones hot!! Imma just say listen to it in its entirety and tell me anyone in the scene has better tone than Mikey..and hes just on fire! Now the set closer. Age of Inexperience. I gotta say this is one of my least fav lotus songs..i lit up a cig..they got through the opening composed section..i was like halfway done with my smoke..then the jam kicked in..Holy Heaven..i was drawn right back into the danceparty blackhole of goodness all around me. Wow this jam is massive. Hasnt sold me on the beginning of the song, but at least i know theres an sick jam coming after its over!(aka Twist from Phish, heh.) All in all at least a 7/10 first set that alone deserves a listen, with moments of brilliance all over it. But here comes the kicker. Set 2 of this show may be the best single set of lotus music ever, certainly the most mature and the most descriptive of their current mood and direction, all while usuing older material to illustrte this. I cant tell you enough about this set of music. To not hear it is ear-abuse. the operner Expired slang is always welcome, not to mention its flawless and everything that song could possibly be. Then the first sandwich of the night..Jump->Jug->Jump. Wow. Intense. Perfect. This may quite simply be the best juggarnaut ever. Beyond words while it was going down..the entire crowd just synched up into one psychic dance fever organism..that finally drops back into a raging jump ending that just seals the deal. You will love this, i thought this had to be the peak of the night. Oh no no no, my friends. What we have next is the Meat of the evening. Didd Fatt!!!! Oh glory how long i been wanting to catch this..right on with the ever evolving yet coherant mood of the night..so tight..leading right into the straight up, down and dirty, make you wanna f%$#, funk of Sid!! There had been hints of the funk all night that all came to a culmination in this sid. And suddenly right in the middle they drop into this phishesqe evil circus theme for a few seconds thats just freaky as hell..very nice. Again, just perfect mature jams and tight ass grooves...that leads right into Sermon!! Which just then proceeds to take the whole night to its final peak..right where it should be at the end of the second set. Danceparty isnt the word. We need a new Term for the Physicality of what goes down at a Lotus show cause its just 5 steps above. Such a clean vibe..so many smiles..such deep funk..what a night..what a scene. Then the owner Evan of nelsons comes out and gives a nice speech real quick, ensuring future Lotus Family gateherings at the Ledges! They Encore with Hammerstrike. At first i was hoping for a wax or spiritualize encore..but after listening 4x to the recording i realize this was the perfect closer to complete and dissolve the mood of the evening and release us all to the 6 hours of latenight goodness partying that then proceded to happen. This also may be a top version of hammerstrike..with Mikey again just slaughtering his guitar on this one near the end of the jam. Side notes: Dj Harry spun between sets and if you havent seen him yet make a point to..hes just amazing and so dirty. It was so nice to just wander 30 yards between sets and have him steal your face like what. A perfect night indeed. Download this right now..you NEED to hear this one peoples! namaste.	Mike D.

66983	13031	6	good show	nothing crazy special. Dont know what the first reviewer was on, but i wouldnt bother reading that 15 page synopsis.....\n\nok show, nothing crazy special, but i know that everyone had a blast. great venue, excellent atmosphere. There are a few highlights to the show but it doesn't go anywhere unexplored.	shaftz0r	2016-07-07 14:30:46-04	2008-08-08 09:43:40-04
66984	13031	10	Top Notch Show	This is so far the top performance of 2008 for me. Although I generally love Lotus performances and rate 5 stars...in retrospect this would either have to be a 6 or the others bumped to 4. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but Shaft is pretty much known for his pessimism around the Lotus camp. The show is #1 for me for these reasons: complexity of setlist, flawless seguing, range of genres covered, overall vibe, length, quality of recording, and the personal experience of being there. I'll give my track run down as well.\n\nSet 1:\nThe opener Jam > Nematode was deliberately subtle and really got the crowd eager to see what was in store...Nematode is a refreshing jazzy version with a high powered jam finish. Reich has a beautiful and nourishing lead in. Chuck stands out hard on percussion during this number and it has a particularly dreamy/psychedelic jam. There is a very smooth and light segue into Slow Cooking which features a rare dark Lotus jam. Luke uses a really tight organ synth effect and the sound makes me picture a factory working on stage. Moonset set the place rocking and was implemented with full control. The Living Storm gets funky as hell with Jesse struttin out crisp baselines. It develops into an all out dance party with Mike leading with a soulful jam on guitar.  The Mikesnack is by far the dirtiest and funkiest version I have ever heard. Mike gets bluesy as hell and with performances like this solidifies himself as a rising star on the scene. The AoE to finish it off was straight funk. This song in particular has seen tremendous growth since its conception last fall. \n\nSet II\nExpired Slang kickoff was tight and has a rock heavy jam. The Jump Off > Jugg > Jump off is straight up obnoxious and potentially the highlight of this incredible show for me. Jump off rocks off in regular high energy fashion and blends into a mystery/spacey jam in Jugg...it is really impossible to even tell its Jugg until about 3 min. into the song. It sails back into Jump Off with what can only be described as a rawkus Rage Against the Machine like jam. Raw guitar licks and deep synth effects. The Did Fatt kept its patented tribal groove and served for a short rest...but 7 min. in the bottom drops out into some sick DnB with Steve laying shit down on drums. 12 min. explodes into heavy guitar work. Sid goes from funky beach sides tropics into just straight up funk > FlowerSermon which was just 18 min of dance party mayhem. One particular moment Mike plays a slow, but beautiful and inspirational guitar lick over the fast paced dance grooves unlike I have ever heard in this song. Hammerstrike for the closer really matched the mood of the venue (Freedom and Liberation) and served as foreshadowing for the obnoxiously dirty Hammerstrike tour to come this fall.\n\nOverall, the show was extremely explorational. It show cased the versatility and cohesion of the band in its finest form. Sorry for the long review, but I felt it was important to articulate why this is a stand out performance instead of just flinging a thumbs up. Thanks Mike D. for an awesome review as well. There is not one part of this show that lacks energy. One other think, Scott on the light ROCKED that shit.	FreshFlavor	2016-07-07 14:30:46-04	2008-08-08 13:36:26-04
66985	13031	10	Lotus tearin it up (as usual)	the first set will get you jumping, and then set 2 explodes.  excellent sounding recording and great sets. \n\nthe other detailed descriptions below are dead on.	Flying Spaghetti Monster	2016-07-07 14:30:46-04	2008-09-12 14:24:25-04

66987	13031	10	Wow...	...can't believe I this show has been on Archive since last August and I just discovered it now!  \n\nThe second set really did it for me: Jump Off >>>\nJuggernaut >>> Jump Off >>> Did Fatt >>> Sid >>>\nFlower Sermon.  I heard some serious funk and some serious raging in the Jump > Jugg > Jump sequence.  \n\nGreat quality recording as well--solid find all around.

66988	13047	8	Night 2	The way this show started and the energy seemed to be lacking all in all.  It was still a great show, but it was the least powerful of the 4 of the CO. run, imo. I think the crowd didnt provide the energy and the band was drained and it all played off each other. Another GREAT recording by Bret! Thanks.	avant/chicago	2016-07-07 14:30:47-04	2008-04-26 22:25:22-04
66989	13047	10	raging show	I think you are completely wrong.  The show was raging, just not plagued by the obnoxiously large and cramped crowd the fox usually gets.  The show really portrayed the bands true colors and their amazing ability to transition from song to song. Its all clear to me now>shimmer and out> Bubonic tonic!\nAnd what the fuck, how can you argue with A COLORADO Encore	Gingervibes	2016-07-07 14:30:47-04	2008-05-08 03:19:11-04
66990	13047	8	really good, but i know they can do it better!	this sounds great, and i do like some of the jams--the TOTT>juggernaut>TOTT sandwhich is particularly tasty, as well as the "it's all clear to me now"--but i know they can do it harder and better than this. and i'm not a big fan of that daft punk cover. the instrumentation sounds GREAT but the vocoder just sounds off and detracts from the performance. \n\nthis recording does sound really good though, and i'm diggin the new stuff, especially "age of inexperience." so thanks for this one!	psychedelicbrian	2016-07-07 14:30:47-04	2008-10-24 06:32:22-04

I tried everything I could to get into the taper section or any place that would have been conducive to recording the show, I was told by Guest Relations to set up at my assigned seat and that was the best they could do.  Therefore I had no choice but to set up in Section 224.  Absolutely astoundingly surprised to find that the tapes actually sound great!  So, here they are for you to enjoy!\nSpecial thanks to my good buddy Tyler for everything and all the supportive folks in section 224, you know who you are!

My guess is that it was because John Mayer sang it this time, and I think Bobby had been singing it at earlier shows?\n- Oteil and John are OK in my book!  How much fun is Bobby having with these youngsters!\n- Thanks to the band and to the venue for accommodating tapers and allowing us to share the music freely!

E: Friend of the Devil	- Dead & Company - Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Billy Kreutzmann, Jeff Chimenti, Oteil Burbridge, and John Mayer\n- Mickey did not leave the stage for Space.  Once the rest of the band came out, it went almost straight to the Other One Jam.\n- Encore was acoustic - John and Bob on acoustic guitars, Oteil on a hollow-body Four-string bass, and Jeff just played piano.\n- About 28 minutes shorter than Columbus show, but not a wasted moment!\n- One more source for Greensboro - why not?  I saw at least 20 pairs of mics on 11 stands in the taper sections, plus whoever was down front.\n- Last concert I had seen at this venue was Rush on 3-27-1983!  That ticket cost $12.50 plus 25 cents convenience charge.  I lived in Greensboro from Kindergarten to 7th grade, so this was a nice homecoming of sorts.\n- Thanks to the band and to the venue for accommodating tapers and allowing us to share the music freely!  Thanks to all the other tapers for posting shows I had to miss!

A little more audience noise because of location, but  it puts the listener in an ideal "seat" for a wonderful recording.  Thanks to my partner with the Sure mic built for the iPhone, pretty cool stuff.  I had a great time and was very impressed with the lineup.  I Can't wait for MSG and Worcester!!  Maybe more....\n\nEnjoy!

The H5 was directed towards the 3 arrays on Oteil's side. The recorder was approximately eye level with the top speakers of the arrays. My seats were probably 40' forward of the tapers section. I bought my tickets 3 days before the show, and selected these balcony seats above a tunnel, in the hopes that the tunnel height would provide a stand effect for the mics when attached to the railing. \n\nI kept quiet in my seat (until the end), but I didn't ask anyone near me to refrain from talking. So, there's the occasional picked-up conversation and specific voices. And, a lot of whistling that I didn't notice at all during the show!

It was smack in the middle of the section 103 metal risers that were very noisy and the crowd chatter was surrounding us.  However, you wouldn't know any of that by listening to my recording.  It sounds pristine and I am very happy with the quality.  I hope you all enjoy it too!  \nIt was a great little tour for me with Dead & Co and again I was very impressed with the lineup.  This show was my favorite of the three.  Lots of energy and the band is really coming together.  Otiel was really jamming as was everyone!  Including the crowd.  Plenty of chill bumps on this one!\n\nPlease look for my other Dead & Co recordings here on Archive.org\n\nAlbany , NY 10-29-15 under Bob Weir's collection GD2015-10-29 details page\nMSG, NYC, NY 11-07-15 under The Dead  GD2015-11-07 details Page\n\nThanks to all the other tapers, it was great hanging with you all in the OTS!

If only I'd known that the balcony was basically to become general admission for the night, I would have taken this setup to stage left, and pointed it straight at Oteil's stack. I did visit that section, and everyone there was chill.  Alas, I setup in my ticket section and crossed my fingers for a good outcome. My section was more crowded, loud and talkative, which made its way onto the recording. Everyone was great, but the recording definitely got marked up with some near-field audience contributions.

It was nice to meet all my supportive and friendly neighbors in section 9.  The Taper Section really didn't exist.  People were taping from their seats, so that's what I did.  There were some belligerent extremely intoxicated guys in front of me with laminates who were overly loud and seeking everyones attention.  They were very distracting to all who were within a 50 foot radius, however, for the most, part my mics avoid hearing them.  Any chatter you hear on this recording is those idiots.  That said, the tapes came out fantastic and I hope you enjoy the recording!\n\nSee you in Hartford, CT!\n\nMVB	4 mic mix- 2 AKG c414 mics (WideCard) & 2 AKG c451ck8 mics>Tascam DR-70D (as preamp)>Sony M10 @24bit/48kHz	Mark Van Blunk	Mark Van Blunk	Sony M10>Sound Forge Studio 9.0 for tracking, editing and conversion to 16bit/44.1kHz CDR>Free CD Ripper v2.0 FLAC level 8	2016-07-07 13:54:42-04	2016-07-05 23:03:56-04	2	178.25238	11551	1952	2016-06-21

I EAC'd the discs and tracked disc 2 using CDWav.  \n\nI'm assuming this was the only source for the show, as I don't believe there were any other tapers present.  \nIf another source does suface, which I doubt (unless the band has a more complete seed) I will remove \nthis one.  Until then, enjoy Lotus' first trip to Asheville.

We choose stagelip, and its pretty good except for a few sounds that sound a little distant. I think you can even here some talking on this tape in between songs, so imagine what that would be like in the back!

"Fulafare" is our arrangement of a traditional drum ensemble beat. "Mellow Rock IDM Improv" was a sort of Sigur Ros improvised piece that used a couple of different loops. "Jack it Up" is an improv based on loops and vocal samples - we also performed this at NYE. "Music for Mallets Winds and Percussion" is a piece I wrote in college originally arranged for 2 marimbas, vibraphone, clarinet, flute, piano, 2 violins and egg shaker - we rearranged it so Lotus could perform it. "Point/Electric Counterpoint" is based on a loop from Steve Reich's "Electric Counterpoint". "136BPM Dance Improv" was based on a drum loop and synth bass line. So the experiment was Lotus trying new compositional and performance techniques - not a science experiment or a knob twisting fest."

As much as I hate driving around LA,\nI do like playing there.  There was a really diverse crowd of\nethnicities, hippy-types, clubbers, young, old, etc.  Club Fais Do Do\nhad a small stage, and no light rig to speak of, but we got the PA\nbanging and launched in.  DJ Harry was feeling the LA vibe too, and had\na really great intermission set that had the whole place rocking.  We\nhad a solid show too.  Slow Cookin>Suitcases had two great jams, and\nHammerstrike was on point, this is also turning into another big new\nsong.  We debutted the 10th new song of the tour, At Last Glance.  Its\ngot a kind of hip-hop beat and major melodies.	akg481> lunatec V3> tascam da-p1 @48k (ortf dfc @ stagelip)	justin hoogerwerf	justin hoogerwerf	da30mk11> ECHO MIAMIDI> wavelab v5.0[gain changes][resampled to 44.1k]> cdwav v1.94.5> flac16(level 8)	2016-07-07 14:16:24-04	2016-07-01 03:28:33-04	4	10.666667	8148	2132	2006-10-06

I used WaveLab to reduce the gain by -0.03dB in the interest of your playback equipment.  Still quite enjoyable though.  :)\n\nThanks to the band for letting us tape!  \n\nThe owners of the Stone Church reported that this was the most packed its been since they bought it.

They put on a great show.  Hopefully the tracking is close.\n\n\tI originally ran 4 channels.  Two soundboard and two mics.  The output on the board kept shorting \n\tin the left channel, so I scrapped it all together.  There was also an issue with one of the drum \n\tmics (I think). It kept popping on attack.  It almost sounds like when a woofer blows.  You couldn't \n        hear it during the show, but it is apparent in the recording.  It showed up on the SBD as well as\n        the mics, so I don't think it was on my end.  It shows up during the Flower Sermon > Sunrain segues\n\tand a little bit in One Last Hurrah.\n\n\tOther than that I am pleased with the quality of the sound.  It was my first time using the R4.

Levels stabilize at ~40 seconds in.  From approximately 5:53 to 8:28 in track 1 there was distortion coming off of the left channel PA, this was a house sound problem and will be present on all sources. I did notify the sound engineer after a minute or two and he proceeded to correct the problem. I don't think he could hear it with being further back at the soundboard with wind phasing. Other than the 1st song the show is clean.

He taped the show, sent the file to me via Drop Box from a fellow taper's house, and I did the normalization thing, dithered it to 16/44.1, Flacing, etc.\n  I hope the setlist is accurate. I pulled it off a post on the Lotus website (thanks "Harper"), but I'm not familiar with Lotus so I can't attest to its accuracy. I did recognize "Crazy Train" in the "Flower Sermon" sandwich. This is the 11:45 p.m. show. \n  If Bonnaroo is putting up set lists like last year, I can't find them.\n  I'm waiting on Friday's Les Claypool show to arrive!\n\nenjoy!\n\nTape > Share > Support!

It causes the recordings from there to be somewhat bassy (since you're tucked back under the overhang) and overly chatty on the softer parts, but I guess it's an acceptable recording.  I couldn't attend the NYE show, so I only recorded the 30th.  If you want to download the Higher Learning set (it was awesome), please contact me at the email address above and put something about Higher Learning in the subject line so that I can search for your email if it happens to go to my junk folder.  I'll send you the download links.

It causes the recordings from there to be somewhat bassy (since you're tucked back under the overhang) and overly chatty on the softer parts, but I guess it's an acceptable recording.  I couldn't attend the NYE show, so I only recorded the 30th.  If you want to download the Higher Learning set (it was awesome), please contact me at the email address above and put something about Higher Learning in the subject line so that I can search for your email if it happens to go to my junk folder.
